it.Burn it.Gift it.Pass it along to a friend.Do\nsomething with it.This book is for those who may be either curious about the\nDomination/submission lifestyle, or find themselves suddenly a part of it, and\nneedful of information to fill the gaps in their knowledge and experience.Though written from the admittedly highly subjective perspective of a male\nheterosexual Dominant with over thirty years of real-life experience in D/s\nrelationships, great pains have been taken to apply a modicum of objectivity to\nthe endeavor.It’s probably important to state up-front that there is, always has been, and\nalways will be a great deal of controversy both in and outside of the D/s lifestyle\nabout many of the topics discussed in this book.Frankly, there is barely any\nconsensus even on the question of whether Domination/submission constitutes a\n“lifestyle” at all.Opinions on that particular question range from the one\nextreme of classifying it as a mental disorder and aberration, to the other of\nelevating it to the status of a faux religion or divine truth.The reality can be\nfound somewhere in the mushy middle, where this lifestyle is simply a choice\nbetween consenting adults on one of the most important aspects of any\nrelationship dynamic.We’re talking, of course, about the essential question:\nwho is really in charge and what, exactly, does that mean?Note the very specific wording.When we say “really” in charge, we’re\nacknowledging a dirty little secret about human relationships in general.Quite\noften – perhaps more often than we care to admit – the person who thinks he or\nshe is in charge, really isn’t.We will discuss that and similar topics at length\nlater in the

just a little ahead of yourself in your quest for knowledge about the\nlifestyle.For the purposes of this book, we will treat Domination/submission as\na mindset and relationship dynamic; certainly an important aspect of who you\nare.As we explore further the mechanics of what one does in this lifestyle, we\nwill attempt to consistently refer to that as BDSM, or Bondage Discipline\nSadism and Masochism.Why should it be important to make the distinction?Consider the fact that most\npeople who are D/s at their core do not want to spend the rest of their lives with\nsomeone who considers it a Saturday night kink that can be discarded on a whim\nat some point in the future.Imagine the horror of a submissive who wakes up\none morning to discover that the Dominant she depends upon and worships as\nLord and Master has suddenly decided it’s his turn to be the submissive.Unfortunately such things can, and do, happen with annoying regularity in the\nlifestyle.I consider Domination/submission to be what happens in your head and heart.It’s all about how you love, and how you express that love.BDSM is more about\nwhat physically happens between you and your partner or playmates.It’s\nsomething you do.Is there often a certain degree of overlap?Of course there is,\nall the time.In fact, for most people, the more overlap the better.But there are\nalso relationships where they can be completely separate, and some people\nhappen to like it that way.The stereotypical 1950’s television sitcom marriage\nthat portrayed the husband as king of his castle, and his spouse as a stay-at-home\nsubmissive housewife who fretted about “ring around the collar” is probably a\ngood portrayal of how D/s can exist without BDSM.How do you know whether you’re dominant or submissive at your core?The\nodds are actually pretty good that you are neither and, frankly, there’s absolutely\nnothing wrong with that.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CYfZm/UFip8rtaGmzRGgh3BwsFdbv3RCbEr5dIHVFP8="},"a3ccf652-2fa2-43f9-80e2-d46633988ad4":{"id_":"a3ccf652-2fa2-43f9-80e2-d46633988ad4","metadata":{"page_number":12,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

of thing happens to dominant people who are required to function as\nsubordinates at work or in relationships.We’ll discuss various ways to help a person to determine their core D/s\npersonality type elsewhere in this book.As a general rule of thumb, the mere\nfact that you may be uncertain and questioning about your role probably places\nyou in that not-so-rare category that I like to call “normal.”Most people are\nperfectly comfortable assuming either role, depending on the needs and\nappropriateness of the given situation.A hard-wired or true Dominant knows no\nother way to be, and is often profoundly uncomfortable assuming the role of a\nsubmissive, under any circumstances.Similarly, a hard-wired or true\nsubmissive would sooner cut off her right arm than have to take on a dominant\nrole.If neither of those reactions sounds very familiar to you, then you’re\nprobably like most people, meaning you fall somewhere between those two\nextremes.If BDSM is a growing sexual fascination for you, or simply an opportunity for\nyou and your partner to try something new and exciting, that’s perfectly okay.You can learn a lot from this book, and adopting some BDSM interests and\ntechniques can definitely be a healthy and deliciously kinky way to spice up\nwhat otherwise might be a pretty routine sex life.It is important, however, to\nknow the difference between a kink and a lifestyle, and to be honest about that\nwith your potential partners.The Domination/submission lifestyle, like any other lifestyle choice, can be a\ncomplex yet rewarding way to live if you and your potential partner(s) are\nguided by similar values, follow familiar protocols, and share the same vision.Conversely, your experience with the lifestyle can end up being a train wreck if\nyou fail to take inventory of your own capacity to live in a D/s relationship, as\nwell as your tolerance levels for the great diversity of expression you’ll\nencounter from others in this lifestyle.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mEVLQ3Caxup1ukQ58ekQoqeZDVIhwW10vtjV/BwFhkU="},"2b31a141-fac5-42e0-90fa-bcd655f59e24":{"id_":"2b31a141-fac5-42e0-90fa-bcd655f59e24","metadata":{"page_number":13,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

me an extremely valuable lesson.That book was\npainstakingly researched, heavily footnoted, and meticulously researched from\nthe most credible and authoritative sources available.In the end, that simply\ndidn’t matter.Readers who were predisposed to agree with my world-view ignored the thirty-\nplus pages of footnotes.Conversely, readers who held differing views from\nmine seemed all too

earnest\ndesire to be scrupulously accurate and transparent in my research became,\ninstead, nothing more than a distraction and liability.The lesson I learned from that experience was this: The measure of a book’s\nsuccess isn’t found in its footnotes, it can only be found in its utility.If you find\nthe information contained in the pages of this book to be useful to you, then that\nis a

1: The Dominant\nWhat is a Dominant?Just as we might expect any reasonable discussion of the solar system to focus\nfirst upon our sun, we’re going to begin our examination of\nDomination/submission (D/s) relationships by taking a look at the self-appointed\ncenter of the D/s universe, the Dominant.In any relationship, it is always the\ninterplay of personalities that helps us to understand the true nature of the\nrelationship dynamic at work.It isn’t so much about what happens inside of\ntheir heads, as it is about what happens between the partners in the relationship.This is very much the case in a D/s relationship, where the true expression of\none’s core personality is enhanced by a partner who not only understands it, but\nencourages it and thrives upon it.After all, it’s hard to be a leader without a\nfollower, and vice-versa.In this chapter, we will explore the part that the Dominant plays in this little\nwaltz.Some of the questions we’ll address are: What is a Dominant?What\ndrives a Dominant?How does someone know if he or she is a Dominant?How\ndoes one approach, or please a Dominant?What are the risks and drawbacks of\nbeing a Dominant, or being involved with one?We’ll discuss those, and other\nrelevant questions, because at the risk of appearing to contradict what I’ve just\nsaid in the preceding paragraph, it is important to understand what is going on\ninside of a Dominant’s head as a precursor to understanding what occurs\nbetween a Dominant and his or her submissive.Knowing a Dominant’s heart and mind can often be a difficult thing.A\nDominant, generally speaking, does not appreciate being psychoanalyzed,\ncategorized, or labeled.The reason can be simply stated thusly: Scientia\npotentia est.Knowledge is power.For a Dominant, life is all about power, in\none form or another.It needn’t always be about power over other people.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"s527eNqB3pA3UV35EajYWLuP6JAsVdfkyHOStrnE4DU="},"f6f53ac4-f720-4670-9b1d-6cd0ff11dd25":{"id_":"f6f53ac4-f720-4670-9b1d-6cd0ff11dd25","metadata":{"page_number":18,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

majority of humanity.A very tiny percentage of people will find themselves at either extreme of the\nscale, feeling not just more comfortable there, but profoundly uncomfortable\nwith the mere thought of being anywhere else.That isn’t to say that they can’t\nfunction in roles outside of their core D/s orientation; just that doing so brings\nthem no sense of joy or fulfillment.For some, working or living counter to their\ncore D/s orientation brings them a great deal of emotional stress and makes them\nwant to escape to their inner happy place all the more.So, how does one spot\nthe “true Dominant” in a world where people often change their roles the way\nwe change our socks?The answer lies in that emotional stress and happy place.Everyone experiences stress.It’s an integral part of life, and completely\nunavoidable.In many ways, we are defined by how we handle that stress and by\nhow we process it.Imagine the difference between how you might expect an\noptimist to handle stress, versus how you might expect a pessimist to handle the\nsame stressful situation.Imagine further how surprised you might be if a good\nfriend, who always seemed cheerful and optimistic on the surface, inexplicably\nshifts into “doom and gloom” mode whenever the crapola hits the fan.Does\nthat sound like anyone you know?If so, then you’ve experienced first-hand the\nphenomenon we’re talking about.Your friend operates one way on the surface, when things are going the way they\nshould, and another way below the surface, when things aren’t going quite so\nwell.While we may sometimes refer to this as seeing someone “freak out,” in\nreality, what you’re seeing is simply a case of someone reverting to type.At a\ncertain point, under extreme duress, a person no longer cares what anyone thinks\nand they abandon their carefully crafted façade and fall back upon their core\ncoping strategy.Sometimes that core personality characteristic is in sync with\ntheir public persona and sometimes it isn’t.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kqebBlTjJwzzTNvtqicfd/ItSWUtHEKDEjr4BDEOy50="},"e4c960ab-26aa-4132-890c-2b12a8942d7f":{"id_":"e4c960ab-26aa-4132-890c-2b12a8942d7f","metadata":{"page_number":20,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

a Dominant\nCan a person be trained to be a Dominant?The answer is complicated, and\ndepends entirely upon what kind of Dominant you’re referring to, how badly the\nperson in question wants it, and whether he is capable of fundamental change on\na core personality level.The first factor is: What kind of Dominant are you trying to produce through\ntraining?If the answer to that question is, you’re looking to train a person who\ncan be taught to act in a Dominant role, well then of course you can train\nsomeone to be a Dominant.Anyone with even a modicum of acting ability will\nfit the bill nicely.Of course, the issue then becomes, to what extent can you\nexpect that person to “stay in character” and will he be capable of fulfilling\nthose expectations?One should always remember that a person who is taught to\nplay the role of a Dominant and puts on that mantle may eventually grow bored\nwith the role at some point and cast it off.While it is true that such an\neventuality may not be too critical in a mutual role play environment, it can be\ncompletely devastating in other situations.When serious relationship\ncommitments are made based upon the reasonable expectation

nutshell: Yes, it is possible.It’s very\ndifficult, but it is possible.Whether it should be attempted depends entirely on\nthe trainer, the person being trained, his reasons for wanting to be trained,

This task usually falls into the category\nof “far easier said than done.” One way to explore this part of the process is to\nask deep, thought-provoking questions that are designed to take a person beyond\nthe superficial stereotypes that are generally associated with the D/s lifestyle in\ngeneral, and with being a Dominant in particular.\nOne of those questions is: What does it really mean to you to have a submissive,\nor slave? The superficial, stereotypical answer is usually something like: I get to\ntell someone what to do, and she has to obey me. But how many people have\nreally given much thought to anything beyond that point? I always follow that\nquestion up with a few more, like the following:\n· What if you tell your submissive what to do, and she doesn’t obey\nyou? What then?\n· Why in the world should your submissive want to obey you?\n· What if your directives turn out to be wrong, misguided, or even\ndangerous?\n· What are the limits to your responsibilities to your submissive, or her\nresponsibilities to you?\n· Are you required to fulfill any, or all, of her needs?\n· Where do you draw the line at meeting her emotional, physical,\nintellectual, financial, social or educational needs?\n· Would you be prepared to put her through school, pay her bills, or care\nfor her if she were incapacitated?\nIf some of those questions sound an awful lot like the sort of questions people\nshould be asking before entering into a marriage, guess what?

of Dominants\nThere are many different kinds of Dominants that you’ll encounter in the D/s\nlifestyle and, as you may well imagine, it’s rare that anyone will match an\narchetypal profile exactly.As is the case with any stereotype, the more you\nknow about an individual, the less they will seem to match any generalization.As I mentioned earlier, I also think it’s important to determine, to the best of\nyour ability, the degree to which being a Dominant is hardwired into the\nperson’s brain, as opposed to being the product of role play behavior.This is\none area where assumptions can lead to some reeeeeally bad decisions.What follows, in no particular order, is a list of what I consider to be the eight\ngeneral types of Dominants and a ninth category of non-Dominant.The Sadistic Dom\nA Sadistic Dominant is one who enjoys or becomes sexually aroused from\ninflicting physical or emotional pain or discomfort upon his partners.Whether\nor not his partner is a masochist (someone who enjoys pain) is usually irrelevant\nto the pleasure that a Sadistic Dominant gets from inflicting it.Within this\ncategory of Dominant, there is a wide spectrum of sadism that can range from\nthe minimally sadistic yet skilled pain-inflictor on one end, to the abusive or\npathologically dangerous extreme sadist at the other end of the scale.For a\npathological sexual sadist, the mere thought of causing someone permanent or\ncrippling bodily harm or even death may actually be a turn-on.One should\ntherefore always take great caution, especially when meeting or playing with a\nsadistic Dominant for the first time, to attempt to learn what’s on his mind, and\nto protect yourself in the event that things start down a path that you did not\nanticipate.How badly can things go, if and

and\nothers are captured and made slaves.Female slaves are trained in the art of\npleasuring, and are often used for sexual purposes with no consideration given to\ntheir thoughts on the matter.Slaves, who typically wear silks and bells similar\nto what might be considered traditional middle-eastern harem attire, are\nexpected to learn a variety of sexual submission poses, and to accept being\nroutinely loaned out or given to others for sexual favors.Slave girls are often\ntaught to avoid direct eye contact with males, speak of themselves in the third\nperson, and to perform serving rituals and dances.Theoretically, at least, the\ncustoms and protocols of a Gorean relationship are enforced by the sword.Think: Conan the Barbarian meets I Dream of Jeanie.The Daddy or Mommy Dom\nThe Daddy Dom or Mommy Domme is typically a Dominant whose primary\nmode of expressing himself in the D/s lifestyle is through a nurturing sort of\npaternalism or maternalism.The relationship dynamic may involve sexual or\nnonsexual age play, erotic or nonsexual spankings, incest role-play, and other\nforms of role play.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GQUD48d27XKr2JFzDwZBbIgRLkDzkR8/bzR6tRZcMCo="},"469dbb78-fd95-49c6-9edf-9588899c3caf":{"id_":"469dbb78-fd95-49c6-9edf-9588899c3caf","metadata":{"page_number":34,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

think.They’re usually the\npeople who tell you, “I’m a submissive (or switch), but I used to be a Dom.”Translation: “I used to role play being a Dominant until one day, I realized that\nthere really were such things, and that I wasn’t one.”Just because someone discovers the D/s lifestyle through role play doesn’t\nnecessarily mean they can’t successfully adopt it as a way of life and find\nhappiness in a D/s relationship.All who arrive at this lifestyle come by different\npaths, and no path is intrinsically better than another.The important thing is that\nthey arrive safe and sound.Such is not always the case with the next type of Tin\nPot Dominant.The second category of Tin Pot Dom is the self-delusional variety.This poor\nbastard really believes in his innate superiority and unrecognized demi-godhood,\ndespite the overwhelming body of evidence to the contrary.He develops his\nstrategies and techniques, not out of any sense of deception, but from a purely\npragmatic sense of what has worked for him in the past.He simply plays the\nodds.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1rcsziJxMil28oJTwqQZBPyAEsKGbHg7HSZYicnSlEs="},"e95cdea3-8f64-4852-92f2-fb999c4b74ac":{"id_":"e95cdea3-8f64-4852-92f2-fb999c4b74ac","metadata":{"page_number":39,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Two Cents on Being a Dominant\nWhat kind of a Dominant am I?My first impulse has always been to categorize\nmyself as an Ineffable Dom, but I’ve recently come to realize that I’ve always\ndone so not so much because my style of dominance can’t be described, but\nbecause I just don’t like having to describe it.If I had to categorize myself, I would be very tempted to create a whole new\nclassification for myself and the relatively small number of other Dominants\nwho are like me.I would designate it the White Knight Dom.Yes, I know what\nyou’re thinking.You’re thinking that a person would have to be pretty darn full\nof himself to think he can willy-nilly create a whole new category of Dominant\njust for himself and, in fact, you would be absolutely right.Fortunately, when it\ncomes to being full of myself, I am eminently qualified.The White Knight Dom wants to right wrongs, slay dragons, rescue beautiful\nwomen, treat his submissive like a princess, and become King – and he wants to\ndo it all before lunch.He is driven by a deep sense of chivalry and altruism that\ntranscends what he considers to be the sordid and tawdry business of self-\ngratification.The White Knight lives to find solutions to your problems.He\ngets off on learning what makes you tick.He truly isn’t happy unless you’re\nhappy.Where other Dominants might seek out submissives for their own\ngratification, the White Knight seeks them out because that’s what a White\nKnight does as he solves riddles, completes quests, and slays monsters.For the\nWhite Knight, conduct and protocol count for a lot.This is why a submissive’s\nability to convincingly pull off the classic transformation from “princess in\npublic, to whore in the bedroom” is so important to him.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"FLUsKdBi/d5dXKd0MEccCWOA2wYvMjmV9EQiV7Ij42I="},"554037ac-cffb-4706-ab72-7b2f14f40119":{"id_":"554037ac-cffb-4706-ab72-7b2f14f40119","metadata":{"page_number":43,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

A\nsubmissive may be what we call a “true submissive” in the sense that these traits\nare firmly hard-wired into her psyche and she simply doesn’t know any other\nway to be, or she may be acting out a submissive role, whether consciously or\nunconsciously. A submissive is defined\nprimarily by her deep-seated desire to serve and please another, while feeling\nloved, cherished and cared for. You might be surprised to learn that even the\nsubmissive who is an extreme masochist or who craves degradation and\nhumiliation still wants to feel as appreciated and treasured as any other kind of\nsubmissive.\nWe will also, for the purposes of this book, continue in the habit of referring to\nsubmissives with the feminine pronoun “she.”\nAs we stated previously, this is not being done out of any gender bias on the\nauthor’s part, nor in the erroneous belief that all submissives are female or,\nconversely, that all females are or should be submissive. No, nothing of the\nsort. It is simply a hat-tip to the fact that in our society,\nsubmission is typically seen as a feminine trait, and statistics have generally\nsupported the notion that the majority of submissives in the D/s lifestyle just\nhappen to be female.

To assist you with that\nconundrum, we’ll explore a series of probing questions on the subject, just as we\ndid in the previous chapter. As I cautioned you in our earlier\ndiscussion on Dominants, much depends upon how well you know yourself, or\nat the very least, upon your willingness to do some soul-searching as you ponder\nthese questions. Additionally, you should give considerable thought to\nwhether your answers are describing your innate, hard-wired core character\ntraits, or roles which you are able to assume or cast off as the situation demands.\nA true submissive cannot simply remove her “submissive hat” and replace it\nwith a “Dominant hat.” That’s because her submission is hard-wired into her\nhead, and not her hat.\nAnyone in the D/s lifestyle who has the ability to shift their behavior from\nsubmissive to Dominant and back again at will is appropriately called a\n“switch.” Outside of the D/s lifestyle, there’s another name for people who can\nswitch back and forth between these roles as appropriate. We call these people\n“normal.” There’s nothing at all unusual about someone who excels in her\ncareer as an obedient underling to the CEO, a domineering supervisor to those\nshe manages in her department, a submissive partner to her spouse at home, and\ntyrant to her children. That’s what most normal people do on a day to day basis.\nIt is only when you add the whips and chains aspect that it starts to sound kinky.\nFor more on switches, see Chapter 3: The Switch.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1666,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"a/mX6gWj/r+Ifg24gMEIrMWzWF9F5sug25nYc+eZWvE="},"1a0fa463-4270-4492-bec0-1bb6332a7af1":{"id_":"1a0fa463-4270-4492-bec0-1bb6332a7af1","metadata":{"page_number":48,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_48","metadata":{"page_number":48,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"kyDQgRUts3UIHE342Gm0MxlqwgR4xaqnvm9528z0XK8="}},"text":"Introspection\nIf you are someone who is wondering if you are “hard wired” to be a\nsubmissive, or whether you are suited to assume the role of a submissive, some\nintrospection can help you to sort through the issues\ninvolved.

Doing a little\nyard work for the elderly widow who lives next door, or volunteering your time\nto the local food bank are just a few examples of the types of service that benefit\nthe one who performs the service as much as the\nrecipient. If performing service to help a complete stranger can bring you joy\nand fulfillment, imagine how much happier you might be if you were given the\nopportunity to do something similar for someone that you love and respect. If\nthe idea of service to the one you love warms the cockles of your heart, then you\njust might be a submissive.\nDo you find yourself instinctively sacrificing your own comfort, well-being, or\nmaterial things for others? This question is similar to the previous one regarding\nservice, but there is a distinct difference\nbetween service and sacrifice. Service is cooking dinner for your kids.

something can be considered real power if it isn’t\nexercised or exploited.Some people believe that it isn’t so much power that is\nexchanged in TPE, as it is authority.The intrinsic difference between power and\nauthority can best be explained thusly: If we were talking about a car, then\npower would be what was under the hood.Exercising that power would mean\ntaking the car out for a spin.Having the authority to do so might involve a\ndriver’s license, possessing the keys, or having the title and registration.In a long-term, committed D/s relationship, both power and authority are\nexchanged to an exponentially greater degree than in any short-term,\nuncommitted BDSM play scenario.The reasons for this should be fairly\nobvious but, to the casual observer, the true nature of the two way exchange may\nnot be.It may be easy to see the authority that a submissive grants to her\nDominant to exercise power over her life.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"07d3g9PR3DenRL59PlBSH/pLJkOayDUXUzQgVGVn31g="},"5361081b-4a32-4a8f-aaae-cb5dd3c7d230":{"id_":"5361081b-4a32-4a8f-aaae-cb5dd3c7d230","metadata":{"page_number":55,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

such as the power to choose or reject a Dominant or to\nleave a dysfunctional D/s relationship, isn’t something that is granted to the\nsubmissive by the Dominant.Those powers are considered by many to be god-\ngiven, cultural, and legal in nature, and universal to everyone.So, if the power\nto say no to a Dominant shouldn’t be considered part of this so-called power\nexchange, then what should?I believe the answer lies in asking the question in a different way.Every\nDominant should make it a point to ask his submissive some variation of the\nfollowing: “Have I empowered you?If so, how?”The responses you get just\nmight surprise you.Here are just a few of the real responses that I have received\nwhen I have posed that question to a submissive:\n· You empowered me by forcing me to be

Dominant, used and abused physically, emotionally, and sexually, and\nthen unceremoniously dumped like yesterday’s Chinese take-out.The Novice’s\nfirst collar typically lasts about as long as it takes the so-called Dominant to\nreach an orgasm or, conversely, to learn that it isn’t going to happen.Sometimes, the collar will just fade away in a muddled fog of uncertainly over\nthe following days or weeks as the hapless Novice struggles to figure out what\nwent wrong and whether or not she still has a Dominant.Nevertheless, the\nundeterred Novice usually sets out again to do it all over again, ad

kittens, puppies, and ponies.Kitten play allows the submissive to\ndemonstrate feline characteristics, seductive mannerisms, and perhaps even a\nstreak of independence.Puppy play is more often than not characterized by\neager devotion, playfulness, mischievousness, collars and leashes.Pony\nsubmissives typically fall into three categories themselves: cart ponies, riding\nponies, and show ponies.Cart ponies pull a small cart called a sulky, which\ncarries her owner.Riding ponies prefer to be ridden directly, either while on all\nfours, or standing with the rider on her back or shoulders.Since this can be\nproblematic due to the rider’s weight, it is often simulated.Show ponies are all\nabout the dressage, and often wear very elaborate plumes, braids, harnesses,\nbridles, and other decorative items.A Pet submissive who assumes the roles of multiple types of pets is sometimes\nknown as a hybrid.It should also be noted that pet play is also sometimes used\nby submissive-leaning switches to try out roles where disobedience is expected\nand tolerated, such as the role of a disobedient puppy.Another point worth\nnoting is the fact that Pet play is frequently a Novice submissive’s first real\nexposure to the D/s dynamic due to its low level of complexity and the relative\nease with which one can keep things on a nonsexual level.It is relatively\ncommon among teenagers in online chat venues to be involved in pet play, either\nas furries, or in other forms of role play.Parents of very young teens who are\nfurries just might want to ask themselves,

Switches fall into two\ngeneral categories: BDSM Switches and D/s\nSwitches.\nBDSM Switches are individuals who enjoy performing in either the role of a Top\nor a Bottom, depending upon the circumstances, their moods, or their\npartners. D/s Switches are people who feel and relate to their partners as\nDominants or submissives, for essentially the same reasons. Because the D/s and\nBDSM cultures are overwhelmingly\nfocused on issues relating to domination and submission, Switches are\nsometimes regarded by others in the lifestyle with a certain degree of suspicion,\ncondescension or bemusement. The primary source of this prejudicial\nattitude tends to be the widespread misconception that Switches are simply\nconfused or unaware of their true orientation. This erroneous belief is founded\nupon the naive assumption that everyone must either be a Dominant or a\nsubmissive. The truth of the matter is most people\nare neither.

I would venture to guess\nthat only about ten percent of the general population can truly count\nthemselves as Dominants, and another ten percent as submissives. The\nother eighty percent of the human race falls somewhere in the middle; they\nexhibit characteristics of either, or both, depending on a variety of\nfactors. These individuals should never feel pressured to decide whether they\nare Dominants or submissives because in truth, they may be neither, and there’s\nabsolutely nothing wrong with that. Among the vanilla population, these folks\nare simply thought of as being normal.\nUnfortunately, in the BDSM culture, they are often considered confused, just\nexperimenting, or still learning when, ironically, it is often the case that an\nindividual has realized that he or she is a Switch only after a great deal of soul\nsearching, experimentation and learning.\nDecades ago, being a Switch generally meant something else, entirely. The\nclassical definition of Switch used to refer to a person (usually a female) who\nwas always submissive to one person, and Dominant towards another.\nHistorically, this manifested\nitself typically in poly relationships consisting of a male Dominant head of\nhousehold living under the same roof with two submissive females, one of which\nwas the more dominant. In such a scenario, the more dominant of the two\nfemales is always submissive to the male Dominant, and yet simultaneously\nalways Dominant towards the other submissive female. The meaning of the\nword has evolved over the past thirty years or\nso to better serve the purposes of a post-modern BDSM culture that embraces\nexperimentation, self-determination and kink-tolerance. Even so, even\ntoday, there are still many people who consider themselves Switches who\ncategorize themselves as such on the basis of the classical definition of the word.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1883,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"akJRG612OV/ys/R5EVO1PRr9WjjEqEROKRjML2eYM14="},"cee3338e-7a3b-48d1-83b9-bba6a8c19b59":{"id_":"cee3338e-7a3b-48d1-83b9-bba6a8c19b59","metadata":{"page_number":75,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_75","metadata":{"page_number":75,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Sip8UF1tis/t0ksBr90vGC1mPVzDCU+OFdKyAhopY8U="}},"text":"In some ways, perceptions of Switches in the BDSM\ncommunity may be similar to how bisexuals are sometimes viewed by straights\nand gays. Many heterosexuals have an\nunfortunate tendency to view bisexuals as gay. Conversely, there are members\nof the gay community who demonstrate a bias against bisexuals by\ncharacterizing them as straight people playing at being gay.\nPerhaps this is all due to the fact that we all have a very human need to interpret\nour environments in simple terms. We want to see things as being black or\nwhite. We really don’t like all those pesky\nshades of grey in-between. It messes with our sense of balance; we want things\nuncomplicated. You try one kind of sushi, discover that you don’t care for it,\nand you say, “I don’t like sushi.” Never mind that there are literally thousands\nof different kinds of sushi out there that you haven’t tried. That would be far too\ndifficult to contemplate.\nThis tendency to oversimplify things can lead people to believe that certain\nthings are opposites and mutually exclusive when, in fact, they are nothing of the\nsort. Domination and submission\nare not opposites, nor are they mutually exclusive in any way.\nA person can be both simultaneously, as in the poly household with the\n“Dominant submissive” who is always sub to the male head of the household,\nand always dominant with the other female sub. Many people also\nerroneously consider sadism and masochism to be opposites and mutually\nexclusive. They are not. A person can easily be simultaneously a sadist and a\nmasochist and, in fact, it’s extremely common in the fetish lifestyle. If you’re\nstill having a difficult time wrapping\nyour head around this concept, consider this analogy: when a thirty-year-old\nwoman takes her ten-year-old daughter to visit grandma, she is simultaneously a\nmother and a daughter.

I believe that there are a few definitive\ntraits and characteristics that are common to\nmost Switches. Let’s examine them.\nThe first characteristic would necessarily have to be an involvement in the D/s or\nBDSM lifestyle. Without some degree of involvement in the lifestyle, virtually\nanyone (kinky or vanilla) who doesn’t consider himself a Dominant or\nsubmissive would have to be categorized as a Switch. There are at least three\ngood reasons why this would be neither smart nor effective.\nFirst, the mere fact that someone doesn’t consider himself a Dominant or a\nsubmissive doesn’t necessarily mean that he isn’t one. There are a lot of people\nout there who simply haven’t yet learned that there are other people like them,\nand that there is a name for what they are. Lumping those individuals into the\ncategory of Switch by default would not be helpful to them in any conceivable\nway, and could actually hinder their journey of self-discovery.\nSecond, any categorization that gives a member of the vanilla community a\nBDSM label, regardless of the character traits that he or she\nexhibits, does a disservice to both communities. Finally, the mere application of\nsuch a label to a group so large that it applies to eighty\npercent of the world’s population would have the undesired effect of watering\ndown its meaning to the point of not really meaning anything at all.\nThe second characteristic which is common to most Switches is the enjoyment of\nperforming in both Dominant and submissive roles, depending upon the\ncircumstances, mood or partner.

D/s Switch, the Submissive-leaning\nD/s Switch, the Balanced D/s Switch, the Top-leaning BDSM Switch, the\nBottom-leaning BDSM Switch, the Balanced BDSM Switch, and the D/s-BDSM\nSwitch.As we cover each of the following categories of Switches, keep in mind that D/s\nis all about the relationship dynamic, while BDSM is about the kink activities.For many people, there is a great deal of overlap that occurs between the two\nbut, for others, there may not be any at all.It’s very much analogous to love and\nsex.For some people, it’s all about love.For others, it’s all about sex.Ideally,\nfor most people, it’s nice to have both, and preferably with the same person.At\nthe risk of beating a dead horse, we can take this analogy even further: Being a\nSwitch could, as we mentioned earlier in this chapter, easily be compared to\nbeing a bisexual.A man could be madly in love with his wife, yet sexually\nattracted to both men and women.In such a scenario, his relationship dynamic\nmay be

other slaves, he does sometimes engage in BDSM\nplay with them, and often switches with a preference for bottoming.Balanced BDSM Switch\nThe Balanced BDSM Switch is equally attracted to and finds fulfillment in the\nrole of a Top or a Bottom in his kink activities.Example: Sierra is a submissive\nin her primary relationship with her Dominant Joseph, and that never changes.However, at BDSM play

Two Cents on Switches\nI’ve spent much of my life completely mystified by Switches, on a number of\nlevels.When I was much younger, I was simply baffled by their seemingly\nnatural ability to do what they do.For someone like me, hard-wired since birth\nas a Dominant and tempered by twenty years of military leadership training and\nexperience, it was a completely foreign concept.It might have been easier to\nconvince me that a person could just grow different sex organs at will, than to\nconvince me that they could willy-nilly change their dominance-orientation.I’ve also gotten frustrated at times because some Switches seemed unable or\nunwilling to understand that not everyone can (or should) do what they do.Whenever I read or hear someone repeat the mantra that it is impossible to be a\ngood Dominant unless you have first experienced what it is like to be a\nsubmissive, my head threatens to undergo what Douglas Adams likes to call a\nserious case of nonlinear, catastrophic structural exasperation.To me, that\nmakes about as much sense as asserting that you can’t possibly understand what\nit is like to be heterosexual, unless you’ve spent some time as a homosexual, or\nvice versa.Want to know what makes a “good Dominant?”It is someone who finds joy and\nfulfillment in guiding, teaching, caring for and protecting the right person.Want\nto know what makes a “good submissive?”It is someone who finds joy and\nfulfillment in pleasing, service to, caring for and taking direction from the right\nperson.A Switch finds joy and fulfillment in either, or both, depending on the\ncircumstances.It really isn’t any more complicated than that.Things may not\nbe quite so cut and dry when it comes to Tops and bottoms, however.If we’re\ntalking about the physical and psychological effects of certain kinds of BDSM\nplay, then I think it makes perfect sense that you should be familiar with both\nends of the equipment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Gmmfo3FOLEaBHWTYdnQUHpZ7EynZpkqY4OyB1iNI2AM="},"2bf7d5a0-90fc-4cf5-a61e-23e413e246ad":{"id_":"2bf7d5a0-90fc-4cf5-a61e-23e413e246ad","metadata":{"page_number":84,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

2.a role that is neither consistently\ndominant nor submissive but can be either depending upon the environment,\nsituation and personal dynamic at work; 3.a type of BDSM play that focuses on\nthe animalistic aspects of relationships and sexuality.Primals are a relatively new phenomenon in the BDSM culture; one that is still\nregarded with a great deal of curiosity by those who have long been content to\ncategorize everyone in the D/s lifestyle as a Dominant, submissive, or switch.There was just one little problem with that classification method, however.It\nleft an awful lot of people standing on the sidelines, wondering why they didn’t\nseem to fit neatly into any of those three categories.Primalism is often\nassociated with animal play, pet play or furries, and while it may share key\ncharacteristics with them, it stands apart from them due to its focus on instincts,\nperception, disdain for social conventions, and an agonizingly unpredictable D/s\ndynamic.This all may seem a bit confusing to you until you actually get to\nknow someone who is a Primal, or suddenly come to the realization that you\nhappen to be one, yourself.With that in mind, the best place to start may be by\nasking yourself the following questions: Am I a Primal?If I was, how would I\nknow?I’ve come up with just the thing to help you learn the answers to those\nquestions.It’s an amusing little quiz, which I’ve narcissistically entitled\n“Michael Makai’s PRIMAAL Analysis.”The PRIMAAL acronym stands for\nPreliminary Research on Instinctive Mannerisms & Assessment of Animalistic\nLoving.I created the PRIMAAL Analysis for three reasons.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Tqdcujag72TjDOdwT8zZhBD1y/S2mXrD5GZ3afusviA="},"67c81c95-28bd-4692-825d-1d5efdeb18ce":{"id_":"67c81c95-28bd-4692-825d-1d5efdeb18ce","metadata":{"page_number":87,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_87","metadata":{"page_number":87,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"4isWzcp9zAOSKYXzNwTkv5Y7usqkUluBMbDiidr285o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ce4003a9-16ad-405a-abc9-25da2bc4d831","metadata":{"page_number":87,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Tqdcujag72TjDOdwT8zZhBD1y/S2mXrD5GZ3afusviA="}},"text":"I created the PRIMAAL Analysis for three reasons.First, I believe it\nmay be able to help a lot of people who may be Primals, and have been\nstruggling to find their niche in the D/s culture.Second, I think it does a pretty\ngood job of illustrating many of the common mannerisms and characteristics of\nPrimals to those who may be unclear on the concept.And third, creating it was\na lot of fun.If you can’t have a little fun while writing a book, then what’s the","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"6bd1VoNZeZwu+n2JzigRIFpaf2+McothP077FLQkQ3M="},"bd7f1033-a530-4ed4-bc87-5112656b1f03":{"id_":"bd7f1033-a530-4ed4-bc87-5112656b1f03","metadata":{"page_number":88,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_88","metadata":{"page_number":88,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"0fL4fG3zRt2B/T6/rxKl2R9vqLWl7PCFLaXxcAQLe6U="}},"text":"point?\nSo, at the risk of again sounding like a worn-out Jeff Foxworthy comedy routine,\nwe’re going to explore some of the tell-tale signs which may indicate that you\njust might be a Primal.

Preferences\nNow that we’ve gotten a glimpse of what a Primal looks like, it should be\nsignificantly easier to draw some conclusions which can help us to more\naccurately define what it is that makes a person a Primal and take a look at what\ngoes on inside of a Primal’s head.The psycho-social pieces of the Primal puzzle\nare important because, for most Primals, this isn’t a role that they play or a\ncostume that they can put on or take off at will.It is who they are.This is not\njust about how they act; it is about how they think, how they relate, and how they\nlove.Let’s examine what I’ve come to call the Primal preferences.They are simply a\nseries of generalities, to be sure, but they can be incredibly useful in\nunderstanding what makes a Primal tick.As always, the use of the male pronoun\n“he” should not be interpreted as a bias for one gender over any other.It is a\nsimply a sad acknowledgment of one of the most frustrating limitations of the\nEnglish language, the aggravating lack of a gender-neutral singular pronoun.The first Primal preference, which cuts right to the heart of the entire\nDomination/submission culture, is the unique way in which Primals make a\ndetermination of dominance.It is a process that invariably occurs each time the\nPrimal encounters someone new.In fact, for some Primals it can be an on-going\nprocess, even with their romantic partners and long-time acquaintances.Establishing dominance is almost always an ad hoc, unscripted, and\nunpredictable thing which can be as simple and innocuous as a momentary\nglance, or as violent as a Wrestlemania cage-match.This initial and instinctive determination of pecking-order occurs without any\nconscious thought on the part of the Primal.He doesn’t care about whether or\nnot you want

strength,\nendurance and tolerance for pain, but you probably shouldn’t be too surprised if\nit does.Another Primal preference is their reliance upon predator-prey behaviors.A\nPrimal categorizes all others as either predator or prey, and treats them\nappropriately.He carefully observes, stalks, tracks, hunts, chases, and takes\ndown his prey and relishes every moment of it.If he classifies you as a predator\nyourself, you can expect a Primal to steer a wide path around you, preferring to\nseek out prey, instead.The Primal preference that is probably most familiar to non-Primals is the\naffinity for the sort of love-play that results in biting, scratching, nibbling,\nlicking, nuzzling, or a desire to be pet or stroked.This kind of activity is\ncertainly not exclusive to Primals by any stretch of the imagination, but it is far\nmore prevalent among them than it is in the general population.By the way, the\ntechnical term for becoming sexually aroused by biting is odaxelagnia.Depending upon the situation and his frame of mind, a Primal will often\ndemonstrate a marked reduction, and sometimes even a complete loss, of\ninhibitions.This situational lack of self-consciousness may be exhibited in a\nwide variety of behaviors, to include such things as a general disdain for\nclothing, the emulation of animal sounds such as barking, howling or growling,\nand rambunctious

kind of sex, here.In a nutshell, sex with a Primal may\nnot always be pretty, but it’s definitely never boring.Primals, like many of our four-footed friends, endeavor to process the world\nthrough all five of their senses equally.Where the average human relies\nprimarily on sight and sound, a Primal will often call upon his other senses to\ndistinguish a scent, differentiate a taste, or pinpoint a texture.Sniffing or tasting\na person, place, or thing to learn more about it is a perfectly normal mode of\ninvestigation for a Primal.Once a Primal has codified you in this fashion, any\nchange in your body chemistry is readily apparent to him.A person’s monthly\nhormonal cycles, menstruation, sexual pheromones, medications, hydration\nlevels, hygiene, diet, and even diseases may be an open book for a Primal to\nread.In additional to receiving and processing information to a greater extent\nthrough scent, taste and touch, a Primal is also far more likely to transmit\ninformation through those same senses.It is relatively common, for example,\nfor a Primal to mark his or her home, property, and even friends and partners\nwith a distinctive scent.Another preference particular to Primals would be their attachment to the notion\nof feeding, rather than simply eating and drinking.The connotations attached to\nfeeding suggest a more primitive and instinctive activity that can be applied to\nmore than just food.In the modern pop culture parlance of vampire lore, feeding\ntakes on a sensuously daring and primal ambience all its own which incorporates\nitself nicely into the Primal subculture.Primals typically form tight-knit social groups which they refer to as packs, and\nthey often place their allegiance to the pack higher than their loyalty to even\ntheir biological families.Not all Primals are quite so pack oriented; it often\ndepends upon what sort of animal they identify with, and which of those animal\ncharacteristics they emulate.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HBL89k9hGO1lSk0qmGR8Dt3neWuiXWyssbq/dUebO2s="},"68d13072-5b5d-4128-98ce-1e95c7c6003f":{"id_":"68d13072-5b5d-4128-98ce-1e95c7c6003f","metadata":{"page_number":97,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

based on specific animal species, or no strategy at all.Primals\ncertainly appear to have a higher likelihood of being polyamorous than\nmonogamous, but there is little hard data to support that notion.Some identify\nso strongly with their specific animals, that they will adopt that animal’s mating\nstrategies, as well.A wolf would therefore employ a strategy of monogamy,\nwhereas a lion might feel compelled to build a pride of five or six mates.It’s\nalso entirely possible that for some Primals, surrendering to their animal instincts\nmeans not really having a strategy at all, but simply doing what instinctively\nfeels right at the moment.What comes as a surprise to many who may not be familiar with Primals is the\nfact that they typically do not identify or connect themselves with the Furry\nsubculture.Furries, for the benefit of anyone who may have been living in a\ncave for the past few decades, are people who role-play anthropomorphic animal\ncharacters with human characteristics.A furry may look like a dog, or cat, or\nfox, or skunk, but he walks and talks and acts just like a human being in most\nrespects.In other words, a furry is, in practically every way that counts, the\nexact opposite of a Primal.A Primal is a human who instinctively thinks, acts,\nand perceives the word in an animalistic way.He considers his Primalism a core\npersonality trait, rather than a role, and will often view himself as a human-\nanimal hybrid, or humanimal.A furry, by contrast, is a role-player who is part\nof a fandom, rather than a lifestyle.His fascination is with looking the part of an\nanimal, while maintaining most or all of the characteristics of humanity.Another subtle distinction between Primals and Furries concerns the social\ncircles, events and gatherings that are typical to each.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ICLznPa78r8nUfGHSEMHHMjSDTksbPQAkGMpFVQzekg="},"f755ade8-84b0-4621-9130-453f0aba67f5":{"id_":"f755ade8-84b0-4621-9130-453f0aba67f5","metadata":{"page_number":98,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

for dominance are, at their core, sadomasochistic.That\nwould probably be a mistake.A true sadist enjoys inflicting pain upon others,\nregardless of their feelings on the matter.A true masochist enjoys the\nsensations of pain, regardless of whom or what the source of that pain might be.There are, of course, an infinite number of gradations between an extremely\nhard-core sadist or masochist versus someone who is nominally one.But the\ncommon denominator for all sadists and masochists alike is simply the\nenjoyment of pain for pain’s sake.Sadomasochism is not a phenomenon that occurs naturally in the animal world\nwith any real frequency.Animals typically hunt, kill, or fight for purely\nutilitarian purposes.True, a cat may toy with a mouse before killing it, but that\nbehavior is probably a lot more like playing with your food before eating it, than\nit is an expression of sadism.Primals, too, see pain as a necessary and utilitarian\npart of their mating rituals and for determining dominance.This is not to say\nthat Primals can’t also be sadists or masochists.We’re simply saying that\nPrimals shouldn’t be considered sadomasochistic just because they enjoy biting\nand scratching during sex.Each of these so-called Primal preferences is a gross generalization which may\nor may not necessarily apply to any specific Primal you may know.Whenever\nwe are dealing with animalistic instincts, we have to be prepared to acknowledge\nthat the instincts of a cat are going to differ significantly from those of a dog, or\na monkey, or a penguin.And yes, a Primal may

Scenes\nA primal scene is not something you see every day.That has a lot to do with the\nfact that there’s very little that a primal does that is preplanned.A scene, almost\nby definition, is something that is planned ahead of time.There will, of course,\noccasionally be those times when Primals have made plans to do a scene\ncompletely unrelated to their primalism and serendipity nudges them off-script.When it does happen, it is rarely predictable, and may even be as alarming to\nspectators as it is fascinating to them.By the way, the phrase “primal scene”\ncan mean very different things to different people.Among psychologists, it is a\nterm which refers to witnessing or imagining your parents having sex;\nsomething you just might want to keep in mind if you ever decide to discuss this\ntopic with your shrink.Typically, in the BDSM world, a Primal scene simply happens without a lot of\nforethought.What may start as a bit of cautious sniffing and circling can\nquickly escalate to a scenario where instinct supersedes reason and judgment,\nand life leaps from mundane to extraordinarily interesting in about 2.6 seconds\nflat.Mellissa W., a twenty-six-year-old woman from Kansas, considered herself a\ntraditional submissive before she became involved with a Dominant who seemed\nto play a lot rougher than she had been accustomed to with her previous lovers.That, in itself wasn’t too unusual.What surprised her was her immediate and\ninstinctive reaction to it; a reaction that opened up a part of herself that she had\nnever suspected was there.“We had always been playful and even a little rough at times, but I always\nfigured it was just fun and games.One night I was walking past him and Derek\nsurprised me by grabbing my boob, and I don’t know why, but I

5: Online BDSM Relationships\nMany people get their very first taste of Domination/submission and the BDSM\nlifestyle via the internet.Web sites, chat rooms, fetish portals and virtual worlds\nhave all combined to make the internet a veritable buffet of BDSM and kink in\ngeneral.In fact, it is so plentiful and omnipresent, one often finds BDSM-\nrelated images and references in places it where they shouldn’t be, such as on\nweb sites and in chat rooms that are frequented by under-aged children.If you happen to be one of those people whose only exposure to the BDSM\nlifestyle has been through the internet, you may very well find yourself\nwondering about the differences between the online BDSM lifestyle and the\nreal-world one, and about the validity of your online experiences.Our goal in\nthis chapter will be to try and answer some of those questions for you, and\nperhaps provide you with a road map that will help you to make the leap from\nvirtual D/s relationships to the real thing, if that is what you seek.The online BDSM culture is truly a double-edged sword in many respects.On\none hand, it allows a person with absolutely no prior experience or knowledge of\nthe lifestyle to dip his or her toe into the waters without fear of ridicule or harm.On the other hand, it allows a person with absolutely no prior experience or\nknowledge of the lifestyle to misrepresent himself as an expert, without\nworrying about any potential consequences.The horror stories one hears, again\nand again, are enough to make some people shun the online BDSM culture\nentirely.It is disturbingly common to hear tales of middle-aged submissive\nwomen who learn that their supposed Masters are actually teenage girls.Not\nonly do men turn out to be women, but women are revealed to be men, and\nchildren routinely pose as adults.In short, the one thing that you can trust to be\ntrue when it comes to internet BDSM is: Nothing is ever what it seems.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TOMgAwXnIDB0udTgzKPz+ZSI6G49nYu/bwVBuaVUyOg="},"e9c388f1-12a7-420c-a5df-84879663e928":{"id_":"e9c388f1-12a7-420c-a5df-84879663e928","metadata":{"page_number":109,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

karma is not only a bitch, but she has a wicked sense of humor.Online BDSM culture and relationships can be illusory, deceptive, and abusive.They can also be entertaining, honest, and fulfilling if you approach them with\nopen eyes, the right attitude, and take proper precautions.We’ll discuss those\nprecautions later in this chapter, after we’ve talked about some of the different\nvenues where you may encounter the online BDSM culture.Text-Based BDSM Chat\nFor most of the people who use the internet today, it’s difficult to imagine that\nthere was ever a time when the internet existed without the World Wide Web,\nrobust graphics, or the high speed networks that made them all possible, but\nthere was, and I was caught up in all of it from the very beginning.My first exposure to the online BDSM culture was in the mid-1980s through an\nonline service called CompuServe, which was the very first major internet\nservice provider.In the beginning, CompuServe charged roughly $5 per hour to\nconnect to their network and overseas, where I was stationed at the time, a\nperson could easily spend $30 per hour in surcharges to connect through\nCompuServe’s international nodes.Needless to say, at those prices, only the\nmost obsessed and committed computer geeks bothered to do so.Yes, people\nlike me.The reason for my obsession was something CompuServe called CB Chat.It’s\nhumorous to think of it now, but at the time it was called CB chat because the\nmarketing gurus at CompuServe believed that would be the best way to explain\nthe concept of a chat room to people who had never heard of one before.The\nidea was to invoke the familiar notion of CB, or citizens band, radio.Yes, we’re\ntalking about the very same CB radio fad made famous by the popular 1975 song\n“Convoy” by one-hit wonder C.W.McCall, and the 1978 movie by the same\nname.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lJ9nh7TpCkIyKPbExoplyVq78DWDftWq344ggpxQyIQ="},"7c7c3949-f24e-423c-b38c-0208ccce8389":{"id_":"7c7c3949-f24e-423c-b38c-0208ccce8389","metadata":{"page_number":110,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

chat became available, including America Online (AOL) and a\nmultitude of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) networks.Today, there are literally\nthousands of IRC chat networks in existence, with the four largest being EFnet,\nIRCnet, UnderNet, and DALnet.Many of the customs and online protocols that\nwere developed by the CompuServe fetish community then were adopted by the\nusers of these newer chat platforms, and most are still in practice, even now.During the early days of the internet, certain protocols had to be followed in\norder to make sense of a BDSM culture that could only be expressed in text.There were no websites or social media portals like Facebook or Tumblr.The\nvery notion of being able to have an internet-based voice-chat, a la Skype, was\nstill decades away.Even the ability to attach a photograph to an email in order\nto send it to a friend was beyond the technical abilities of most people.In other\nwords, if your message couldn’t be expressed in letters, numbers, punctuation or\nsymbols, you were quite simply out of luck.So, we adapted.We learned to use plain text to provide all of the necessary vital\nclues to a person’s status, relationship, sexual orientation, and standing in the\nonline BDSM community to anyone who happened to be paying attention and\nknew what to look for.Dominants capitalized the first letter of their names;\nsubmissives used all lower-case letters.Submissives referred to any male\nDominant who was not his or her own as Sir.Female Dominants were referred\nto as Ma’am, Miss, or Mistress.Personal pronouns such as you, him, her, and\nthey were capitalized if you were talking to a Dominant.If we were talking\nabout a Dominant, then we capitalized the Him or Her.If we were unsure, or\nwe were addressing a mixed group, we sometimes used torturous grammatical\nmonstrosities like Y/you, T/them, or even E/everyone.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8yK27bsplY6Oy6bjXP31vPu3zay3f58SmKyQfF6i1Ic="},"6b65236c-201d-44e5-9c5e-6ef31ea7dda3":{"id_":"6b65236c-201d-44e5-9c5e-6ef31ea7dda3","metadata":{"page_number":111,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

the Department of Defense and\ndeployed on ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the\nprecursor to what eventually became the modern internet.By 1978, the first\nnon-commercial virtual world to be deployed on the internet was called MUD1,\nwhich ironically stood for Multi User Dungeon.The dungeon in this particular\ninstance was more of a Dungeons and Dragons sort of dungeon, than a BDSM\none.By the late 1980s, commercial versions of virtual worlds had begun springing\nup, most notably Habitat by Lucas Films, and WorldsAway/Dreamscape by\nCompuServe.These experiments in virtual worlds led the way for the\nimmensely popular Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games\n(MMORPGs) that followed, like Ultima Online and World of Warcraft.Today,\nthe most popular virtual world chat platforms are IMVU for Windows, Second\nLife for Windows, Play Station Home, and The Sims Online.Virtual world chat programs added an exciting visual dimension to what had\npreviously been limited to letters, numbers and symbols.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jP3Yo4sMj5i1E3JUF16FF8DmYzW1T5VuH5xA6PuJK44="},"93e06bd4-bf1c-487c-856b-540addf6b2d0":{"id_":"93e06bd4-bf1c-487c-856b-540addf6b2d0","metadata":{"page_number":112,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Mistress.May I enter?”Not all slave markets require\nsuch formality, but when in doubt, it is usually best to err on the side of high\nprotocol.Upon being granted permission to enter, Dominants should

virtually anyone to pretend to be anything, a person’s\ncredibility becomes his or her only currency.We should take a moment to\nclarify what we mean when we use the word phony in this particular context.If\nwe assume that the online BDSM culture is “real” in its own unique way (at\nleast to the people who are a part of it) then obviously the people who are a part\nof it should be considered real, as well.In other words, the mere fact that a\nperson has no real-life BDSM experience does not mean he or she is a phony.Sometimes, real-life circumstances prevent people from acting on their wants\nand needs.Even so, it may be entirely possible that the person has many years\nof experience in online BDSM relationships and has much to offer someone who\nmay be new and desirous of a mentor.So, what constitutes an online BDSM phony, then?For our purposes, we’ll\ndefine an online BDSM phony as a person who knows little or nothing at all\nabout the BDSM lifestyle – online or real-life – yet attempts to present himself\nas experienced and knowledgeable.The most common example of this kind of\nbehavior is what happens when a young, sexually frustrated person stumbles\nupon the existence of the online BDSM culture and naturally assumes that\nsimply calling himself a “Master” (or “Mistress”) will result in a treasure trove\nof slaves offering sexual favors and unconditional adoration.It never seems to occur to these individuals that there may be more to being a\nDominant than simply calling yourself one.The clueless would-be Dominant\nimmediately launches

The keys to having a successful online BDSM relationship\ngenerally come down to the following three\nfactors: Determining beforehand where the line is that separates your virtual\nBDSM life from your real-world life, deciding for yourself the importance of the\nreality behind the avatars, and asking yourself, “Why am I doing this, and where\nis it going?” The answers to\nthese three questions aren’t easy, nor should they be. In fact, if one or more of\nthe questions seems easy for you, then I would suggest that you’ve probably\nseriously underestimated the complexity and\ngravity of the issues involved.\nThe wildcard that is often overlooked when it comes to online relationships in\ngeneral, and online BDSM relationships in\nparticular, is the role that our emotions play in our perceptions and decision-\nmaking. We often go into these things with one set of expectations, only to\ndiscover - after we have fallen in love - that a completely different set of\nexpectations has suddenly appeared out of nowhere and taken precedence. If\neither partner is unprepared for it when that happens, it can not only be\npotentially devastating to the online\nrelationship, but it can lead to significant problems in their real-lives, as

that separates their virtual lives from their real ones may be flexible,\nfuzzy or may not exist at all.There is little or no cognitive dissonance between\nthe two environments.In fact, for many of the people in this category, the\ninternet is not considered a virtual world or as a completely different\nenvironment at all.It is viewed simply as one more facet of their real-world\nenvironment; another mode of communication that is not unlike talking on the\ntelephone or texting.Just as most people would never characterize a telephone\nconversation as an alternate life, the people in this group typically don’t think of\na graphic internet chat room as one, either.The Toe-Dipper.This second group consists of people who wish to explore the\nlifestyle virtually before making the plunge into the real-life culture.For these\npeople, it may be necessary due to their present circumstances, or simply\npreferable, to learn as much as they can virtually before considering a decision to\nadopt the lifestyle in reality.The individuals in this group must, out of\nnecessity, consider the internet and their real-lives as two separate realities with\nno significant overlap.For them, the separating line is usually quite distinct,\neven though it may move or get fuzzier over time as they grow more confident\nand become more willing to cross the line.In short, the separating line is there,\nbut it is often moving or temporary.The Fantasizer.Third and finally, there are those who, for whatever reason,\ncannot or have no desire to live a BDSM lifestyle in reality, and so they do it\nvirtually.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Kf5YnX3Th/iO4dtyArxQ/LXQo/62QHwes6Bcf2TTxik="},"e1d89d6b-40f9-432d-bf9f-11c972c46857":{"id_":"e1d89d6b-40f9-432d-bf9f-11c972c46857","metadata":{"page_number":120,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Surprisingly, men were significantly more likely to stay committed to\nan online relationship than women.· Not surprisingly, the more a couple engaged in online chat or telephone\ncalls, the better

successful relationship\nthat begins online were significantly higher for middle-aged people (aged 40 to\n69) than they are for younger adults.This was somewhat counter-intuitive to the\nprevailing notion that younger people would be more likely to start a relationship\nonline and would be better at it.Of the 24,000 respondents to the survey:\n· 30% of the respondents had tried online dating or online relationships.· 15% had met their current partners online.· Of the middle-aged group (age 40-69) 36% had met their current\npartner online.· Of the younger adults (age 18-39) only 23% had met

81%.The inevitable question that naturally comes to mind as a\nresult of a study like this is a frightening one: If 81% of those people are lying\non their online profiles, imagine what the percentage

It’s\nincredibly easy to find yourself entangled in an online relationship before you\neven realize what has transpired. If you find yourself waking up or going to\nsleep with thoughts of your online paramour, spending time online simply in the\nhope of seeing that person log on, or putting real life responsibilities off to spend\ntime chatting with that person, it’s time to face the awful\ntruth: Surprise! You’re in an online relationship.\nThe question you should ask yourself is: Is this a relationship that is destined to\ngo anywhere I want to be? It\nhelps, of course, to have some idea where you want to eventually end up; the\noperative word being eventually. You may not be able to make certain changes\nin your life right now, but choosing any path that leads in a direction that doesn’t\nmove you closer to your goals would be counter-productive, at best.\nIt’s been said that men often marry expecting that their spouses will never\nchange, but women marry expecting that their spouses will.\nBoth strategies are completely unrealistic, but they handily demonstrate the\nprevalence of denial and self-delusion that is common at the start of many\nrelationships. If you think online relationships are particularly\nsusceptible, you’re right. And online BDSM relationships are doubly so.

If you don’t know what you want, or what you need in a mate,\nchances are you’re not going to find it. If you can’t differentiate\nbetween what is good for you and what isn’t, you’ll probably end up with a lot\nof the latter, and less of the former. This self-assessment isn’t always easy to do\non your own. You may need to enlist the help of a trusted\nfriend or associate, or perhaps even a trained counselor or therapist to help you\nto see yourself more objectively.\nIt’s often easy to convince ourselves that we’ve simply been the victim of “bad\nluck” when it came to our past relationships, but more often than not, the seeds\nof those failures can be traced to\nmisperceptions or misconceptions which, in turn, produced a series of bad\ndecisions. If insanity can be defined as doing the same thing over\nand over while expecting different results, then when it comes to failed\nrelationships, we all may be just a little\ninsane.\nOnce you’ve done your critical self-assessment, you should take inventory of\nyour needs and wants, being careful to differentiate between the two. Then go\nback down those lists, item by item, and rate\nyour own willingness or ability to compromise on each. It might be useful to use\na numeric scale ranging from one to five. A one means that you’re a complete\npushover when it comes to this issue; if your heels were any rounder, you’d\nprobably just keep rolling.

I just love this\ndescription.)\nThe next step is where things get a little more complicated. Attempt to do the\nvery same thing for your potential\npartner. While it would certainly be helpful at this point if you were a mind-\nreader, chances are pretty good that you aren’t. Therefore, the next best\nstrategy is to simply ask your potential love-interest. There are lots of different\nways you can phrase these questions, but the easiest is typically something like,\n“Wow! So, you’re into foot-worship! Have all your past lovers been into that, as\nwell? Or is this something you are able to compromise on?” When you phrase it\nthat way, it just sounds more like rapt fascination and less like a job interview.\nOnce you are able to compare these two lists, noting your abilities to\ncompromise on key relationship issues, it becomes relatively easy to know if the\ntwo of you are traveling along intersecting paths, or moving in opposite\ndirections. If it appears that the two of you are moving in opposite directions, it\ndoesn’t mean your potential mate is a bad person.

Rewards\nYou might think, after wading through all of the negatives that we’ve discussed\nthus far, that online BDSM relationships are not worth the effort, but that isn’t at\nall the conclusion you should take away from this chapter.Some of the most\nfulfilling and lasting D/s relationships I’ve ever been in began in one fashion or\nanother in an online environment.There really are a lot of positive aspects to\nseeking or exploring a relationship online.Ironically, one of those positive aspects is the paradox that allows people to be\nthemselves behind a cloak of relative anonymity.It’s been proven time and\nagain in psychological studies that people will typically reveal more of their\ninner thoughts and feelings when they believe they are anonymous.Most of us\nare taught from an early age to stifle or conceal our sexual urges, kinks, and\nfetishes.Under the banner of equality, we are indoctrinated for most of our lives\nto reject the notion that some people born leaders and others born followers, or\nthat there may actually be real and significant differences between men and\nwomen.In their quest to eliminate real abuse, many in our society stigmatize\nthose who may find pleasure in pain, enjoy corporal discipline, or find\nfulfillment in giving themselves fully and without reservation to the person they\nlove.Is it any wonder that many people have difficulty finding an outlet for\nexploring and expressing such things?The online environment allows them to\ndo just that.Anyone who has ever been involved in an online relationship can tell you that\nnot only can it be a very freeing experience, but it can also be a very deep one.The medium forces you to focus on what is in your heads and hearts rather than\non things like appearances, age, physical characteristics, sex appeal, or social\nand financial status.For many people, it will be the first time in their lives that\nsomeone is willing to overlook those superficialities to see through to their\nsouls, and that can be quite intoxicating.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"q4ExYg3+6KY6mkF96SsQuRifpFREoGay67+nUz3PLDo="},"c6c51584-c6bc-4217-93b5-0f80ef0c8995":{"id_":"c6c51584-c6bc-4217-93b5-0f80ef0c8995","metadata":{"page_number":134,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

way of working real magic when it comes to separating the\nwheat from the chaff.The faster you move from the first online hello to a\ncommitted real-life relationship, the greater the probability that it will end in an\nepic train wreck.Sure, there are always exceptions to this rule (which I am\nsorely tempted to call Makai’s Law), but the laws of probability are immutable\nand unyielding.You should view any online relationship as an opportunity to\nreally get to know one another at the deepest levels before you start sharing the\nrent.If it is a relationship that is truly meant to be, then the time you spend\ndoing so will be a wise investment.Some of the most rewarding relationships I’ve ever been in began online and\neventually transitioned successfully to real-life, committed relationships.Is it\nmy preferred way to begin a relationship?No, it is not.But, then again, you\ndon’t always get to choose how, when, and with whom you fall in love.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+zEIFasBw+g5ALKxnrGcUD2rZDaUc6EKAe2Tlmh4L0E="},"6f9d4818-0947-4b34-9e0b-5e1e24ebbaef":{"id_":"6f9d4818-0947-4b34-9e0b-5e1e24ebbaef","metadata":{"page_number":135,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

obviously very wrong.“How’s your trial with your new Master going?”I asked.She’d met Drago in\nthis very room, just one week earlier, and had agreed to a trial with him after\nonly a few minutes of conversation.At the time, I’d considered it a rather rash\nand unwise decision, but it really wasn’t my place to say so.Roxy was silent for\na moment, and then hesitatingly replied, “Meh.I told him to go fuck himself.”I nodded silently in response, not giving voice to the first thought that had\npopped into my head, which was: Not entirely unexpected.Instead, I\ndiplomatically said, “I’m sorry to hear that.I’m guessing the trial is off, then?”She gave a little nod and replied, “I guess so.”A moment passed, and she\ntentatively added, “Umm...He threatened me.Do you think I should be\nworried?”“What do you mean, threatened you?”I asked.“What did he say, exactly?”Roxy answered, “He said he would hunt me down in real-life, and kick my ass.He said he would make me sorry that I had spoken to him like that.”Long\npause.“He can’t really do that, can he?”“It’s depends,” I replied.“Which part?Hunt you down, kick your ass, or make\nyou sorry?I’m pretty sure he could accomplish all three.But then again,\nconsidering how hard headed you can be, that whole making you sorry part may\nbe a little harder than he thinks.”Clearly, she didn’t like what she was

Ask someone in the D/s or\nBDSM lifestyle for their definition of a collar, and you’re likely to get a\ncompletely different answer. In fact you’ll probably get a lot of completely\ndifferent answers, because even within the lifestyle, there are divergent opinions\non the significance and meaning of collars.\nIt might be overly simplistic to put forth the idea that the common denominator\nthat binds all of those differing opinions on\ncollars is the notion that a collar represents a commitment of some sort on the\npart of the wearer and the one who bestows the collar, but even that becomes\nproblematic when one considers the fact that collars have become a vanilla\ncounter-culture fashion accessory for many. You’ll also find, even within the\nBDSM culture, that there are some who wear a collar as a fashion statement,\nsocio-political statement, or purely for utilitarian play purposes. Obviously,\nthere isn’t a one-size-fits-all definition that could put any raging collar\ncontroversies to rest, but we can focus on some of the most common\ncharacteristics, types, and assumptions about collars in the BDSM culture.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1481,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4UCYSqa1WwDyiwBuIIdu1hxdvMSQs+22d/3+maGT51U="},"dd1a284c-c224-49a9-b18d-f77888d56a95":{"id_":"dd1a284c-c224-49a9-b18d-f77888d56a95","metadata":{"page_number":140,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_140","metadata":{"page_number":140,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"9bjn+6uIVoGDnqvw8hT1i3GqZkic4IXoIjb7jjbGY9A="}},"text":"Symbolism of the Collar\nTo most of the people in the BDSM lifestyle who assign meaning to a collar, it is\nsymbolic of ownership and represents a mutual commitment.

Unfortunately, this\nsort of thing happens all the time.\nThe actual, physical collars that are used by those in BDSM relationships, if they\nare used at all, may consist of literally anything that is worn around the\nsubmissive’s neck.

often, without regard to whether or not there is\nany real relationship at its core.The rapid growth of BDSM related internet chat\nrooms, games, and instant messaging programs have contributed to an online\nenvironment where casual and often anonymous experimentation occurs with\nfew significant or lingering consequences.As a result, it is not at all unusual to\nsee brand new, curious or naïve self-proclaimed Dominants collaring several\nnew submissives each day.The commitment associated with accepting such a\ncollar is typically limited to a one-night-stand of cybersex, after which the status\nof the pseudo-relationship is dubious, at best.One of the things that make so-called Velcro collars a common phenomenon, at\nleast in the online BDSM community, is the unfortunate tendency on

Collar\nA play collar is any collar that is worn primarily for utilitarian purposes during a\nBDSM play session.Typically, play collars are constructed of leather or metal,\nbut they can literally be made of any material that is appropriate for the type of\nplay that is going to take place.The most common type of play collar used in\nbondage scenes are constructed of durable leather and heavy-duty steel D-rings\nwhich facilitate the attachment of chains, straps, rope, or other restraints to the\ncollar.Other types of play collars may include posture collars, neck corsets,\nsteel lockable collars, rubber or PVC collars, medical (cervical) collars, ball\ngag collars, bit gag collars, or hooded collars.For obvious reasons, play collars\nare not common in the online BDSM culture.Collar of Consideration\nA collar of consideration is a provisional collar that is offered by a Dominant to\na submissive that he is considering as a potential submissive who will\npresumably become eligible for a collar of greater significance and commitment\nat the end of the probationary period.It is typically used to give some\nrecognition to the process of getting to know each other by formalizing a\ntentative commitment by a submissive to discontinue shopping for a Dominant\nwhile being considered by this one, and by the Dominant to treat her as his own\nfor the duration of the agreement.The terms of this tentative agreement should\nbe negotiated prior to the collaring, and are typically set to expire after a\nrelatively short period of time.This is designed to prevent a submissive from\nbeing strung-along by an indecisive Dominant for an indefinite period of time.If, at any time during the agreed-upon consideration period, either party decides\nthat a more serious relationship is not worth pursuing further, that party is\npermitted to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement without fault or blame.Collars of consideration are far more common in the online BDSM culture than\nthey are in real-life.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pEhxNJgQv2H66eFl6+bSdBffpjja4ioZmL8XTk8gS/s="},"0431d82c-8ba3-454b-beab-c157b62ea3c4":{"id_":"0431d82c-8ba3-454b-beab-c157b62ea3c4","metadata":{"page_number":144,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

are also collars of protection; however, not all collars of protection\nare collars of consideration.The reason for this is simple.Sometimes, a\nDominant will extend his protection to a submissive out of friendship or charity,\neven though neither person has any intention whatsoever of establishing a more\nserious relationship with the other as a consequence.The actual nature of the so-\ncalled protection offered to the submissive in these circumstances can vary\nwidely from person to person.As a general rule, it includes offering advice and\nguidance, approving play partners and events, and interviewing and/or approving\nprospective Dominants who may wish to consider the submissive.A typical\nrecipient of a collar of protection is a submissive who is brand new to the\nlifestyle, or perhaps one who has recently been released by her Dominant.One\nof the most useful aspects of a collar of protection is simply the way it serves\nnotice to other Dominants that this submissive is being looked after by someone\nwho is experienced in the lifestyle and has her best interests at heart.Training Collar\nA training collar is, for many submissives, the logical second step that follows a\nshort period of consideration and decision to move forward into a more serious\nand committed relationship.It serves as recognition that, while a more intense\nand formal relationship is desired by both parties, there is still much to be\nlearned by the submissive before a formal collar can be offered.Previously, if\nthe submissive wore a collar of consideration or a collar of protection, her\nactions would not reflect upon the Dominant in any significant way.Now,\nhowever, every action by a submissive in a training collar reflects directly upon\nthe Dominant, telegraphing to everyone his competence - or lack thereof – as a\ntrainer of submissives.This can also be a period of great stress and contention\nas the Dominant and submissive adjust to their new roles in the relationship, and\nlearn to reconcile their expectations and preconceptions with reality.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"P2EmVryueFV+vSqNP3ZCtd1PPL3VQI9Lo75+9wrjVcc="},"e27b32b6-34f4-4647-b079-3ec537fa293c":{"id_":"e27b32b6-34f4-4647-b079-3ec537fa293c","metadata":{"page_number":145,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

can proceed on to the next level.Some of the other challenges\nwhich usually must be overcome by a submissive in training include learning\nhow to properly process fear, doubt and distrust, rendering

phase.If those goals haven’t been\nmet, the training theoretically continues until they are.It is therefore important\nto negotiate, from the very start, exactly what those goals should be, and what\nhappens if they aren’t achieved.Formal Collar\nA formal collar may be known by a host of other names, including slave collar,\nfull collar, or true collar.If one were to consider a collar of

what is usually intended to be a lifelong committed and loving\nrelationship between a Dominant and his submissive.Formal collaring\nceremonies, similar to weddings, are often performed to commemorate and\nconsecrate the beginning of the relationship.Collaring ceremonies typically\ninclude an exchange of vows, spiritual messages, and/or uplifting music, just as\none might expect to see at a vanilla wedding ceremony.Some couples go so far\nas to have both a collaring and a wedding simultaneously, combining the two\nevents into one.The symbolism of a formal collar obviously means different\nthings to different couples, but it is often referred to as the ultimate gift of one’s\nsubmission and self to another; a manifestation of complete and total power\nexchange.Whatever form the relationship

in BDSM environments that typically favor couples and/or\naggressive Dominants.Everyday Collar\nAn everyday collar is anything that can be worn in a vanilla environment to\nsymbolize your D/s

around the neck;\nsome people substitute a ring, bracelet, ankle bracelet, or tattoo.The important\nthing is that, at least in the minds of the D/s couple in question, the item\ndesignated as the everyday collar is firmly associated with and symbolic of their\nrelationship.I’m often asked whether a collared submissive must wear a physical collar of\nsome type to symbolize her commitment to her Dominant.The answer, of\ncourse, is “it depends.”It depends on her Dominant, and her own personal\npreferences.It’s very much like asking, “Does a married woman have to wear a\nwedding ring?”There are a lot of people who would reply, “Absolutely!”And\nyet, there are also those who’ll say just the opposite.A recent survey conducted\nby a wedding industry media group found that 28% of women said they would\nturn down a wedding proposal if they didn’t like the ring!That says a lot about\nthe importance - to some – of the actual ring that symbolizes their union.There\nare no statistics available on how many submissives would turn down a collaring\nproposal if they didn’t like the collar.Let’s reiterate what we said about the symbolism of a collar at the beginning of\nthis section.Each individual

Contracts\nIn this and previous chapters, we’ve repeatedly emphasized the need for frank\ndiscussion and negotiations between any potential partners before entering into a\nD/s relationship.When these negotiations result in any sort of agreement, the\nterms of the agreement often end up in written form, and that document is\nsometimes referred to in the lifestyle as a slave contract, D/s contract, or TPE\n(Total Power Exchange) contract.For the sake of simplicity, we will be using\nthe term slave contract for the remainder of this chapter, but do keep in mind the\nfact that, when we do, we are referring to a wide variety of D/s lifestyle\ncontracts.You should also be aware that the topic of slave contracts is one of\nthe most controversial subjects you’re likely to encounter in the D/s lifestyle.We’ll discuss the reasons for the controversy shortly.The predictable result of\nthe controversy is a confusing hodge-podge of opinions – some authoritative,\nothers not so much - on the utility and value of slave contracts.Before we wade too deeply into the various types of slave contracts that you are\nlikely to encounter in the lifestyle, we should first clarify a few things about\ncontracts in general.There are a lot of misconceptions about contracts and\ncontract law will certainly complicate any attempt to apply those concepts to the\narcane realm of slave contracts.Let’s begin by discussing some of the legal\nrequirements that must be met for any contract to be valid and enforceable.They are:\n· Competency.Both parties must be legally competent to enter into a\ncontract.That means they must be over the age of 18, may not be\nmentally incompetent, and they cannot be intoxicated or impaired.· Mutual Agreement.Both parties must agree to all terms of the\ncontract.If either party disagrees with any portion of the agreement\nwithout the mutual disagreement of the other party, the entire contract is\nvoid.· A Legal Objective.A contract may not

contract could actually be considered a contract for\nprostitution by many states.Finally, many slave contracts contain clauses that\nessentially grant the right to either party to walk away from the

debate currently raging in the American political arena.Nothing stops\nsame-sex couples from entering into contracts that grant each partner the same\nlegal rights and privileges that heterosexual partners are legally able to grant one\nanother.In fact, a contract such as a general power of attorney grants more\nrights and privileges than any marriage does, such as the right to sign your\npartner’s name to a contract, or to access his or her private bank accounts!The\nissue at the heart of same-sex marriage is government recognition and\nparticipation in same-sex marriages, and the couple’s entitlement to the legal\nrights and privileges that governments grant as a condition of that contract.Some activists ask, why does the government recognize and reward some types\nof marriages, and not others?What are the legal or ethical arguments against\nslave marriages, plural marriages, arranged marriages, corporate marriages,\nchild marriages, or even inter-species marriages?And no, simply posing the\nquestion should not be interpreted as advocacy for any of those notions, some of\nwhich are admittedly somewhat extreme.But perhaps it would be appropriate to\nask, why is the government involved in the business of marriage at all?Slave contracts are fairly common in the D/s lifestyle, though you are far more\nlikely to encounter them in the online BDSM culture than you will in real-life.The reality that slave contracts are neither legal nor enforceable makes little\ndifference in an online environment where Masters often don’t even know their\nslave’s real name, age, or gender.The real problem with most slave contracts\nisn’t the fact that they’re not legal; it’s mostly related to the fact that even if they\nwere legal, they’d still be unenforceable.Take, for example, the following verbiage which has been taken directly from a\nslave contract that is commonly used:\n“The parties shall conduct themselves in light of their goals at all times.The goals of the parties are detailed in Section 2(b) of this contract.”There’s a glaring problem with this sort of fuzzy language; it has no real

the ability to choose which particular aspects of their lives she’ll turn\nover to her Dominant to control.It also often defines which parts of the\nrelationship are real versus the parts that are role-played, and may set limits on\nwhat is, or is not, acceptable behavior for either partner.Though many\nsubmissives consider themselves “owned” by their Dominants, the reality is,\nthey are submissive partners, not property.Online Relationship Slave Contract\nAs we stated earlier in this chapter, slave contracts are far more common in the\nonline BDSM culture than anywhere else, for fairly obvious reasons.An online\nrelationship slave contract serves several purposes that are practically tailor-\nmade for the internet culture.For example, when contact with your partner may\nbe limited to just a few minutes or hours each day or less, it may be difficult to\ncommunicate one’s expectations and assumptions to your partner in the limited\ntime that you have.It therefore becomes useful to have a document that can be\nreferred to and studied when your partner is not online.It serves an educational\nfunction.The online slave contract also gives the partners in an online\nrelationship something that is seemingly tangible and authoritative, in an\nenvironment where practically nothing else is.It makes the whole thing seem\nmore real.Finally, online slave contracts help to instill a sense of obligation and\nresponsibility towards the relationship, even though the internet culture in\ngeneral seems to encourage just the opposite.The lyrics of a song called “Do\nYou Want to Date my Avatar,” by Felicia Day and the Guild, illustrate this\ntendency perfectly: “And if you think I’m not the one, log-off!Log-off, and we’ll\nbe done!”The major differences between online slave contracts and real-world contracts\nare the provisions which make certain allowances for the fleeting nature of\nonline relationships, the time constraints, the anonymity of participants, and the\ndisclosure of personal information.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"zJA1FrxOsqDRn9lXassbkGRf1h6IS2lc4jrwcNwdScU="},"278a4191-fee7-487a-8d16-a96d5d56c82c":{"id_":"278a4191-fee7-487a-8d16-a96d5d56c82c","metadata":{"page_number":153,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Scene\ncontracts are usually negotiated prior to an event, and should spell out what is\nsupposed to happen during the scene, identify hard and soft limits, list safety\nprecautions such as safe-words, and specify whether or not sexual or body-fluid\ncontact is permitted.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1241,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YIU6oAd90V+IdZ3/AW2WfKuH910ONPfvABOm1paOynA="},"4dad341d-c951-44d8-95f9-07fd929dd9f3":{"id_":"4dad341d-c951-44d8-95f9-07fd929dd9f3","metadata":{"page_number":155,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_155","metadata":{"page_number":155,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"VhUx+4RNdx7+wngVU3CphFmtCdSrIjkkZU/F17QTtAE="}},"text":"Your Collar, Your Commitment\nIn this chapter, we’ve discussed the various types of commitments that can be\nmade by anyone who might be considering entering into a D/s relationship.

Even though the Gorean novels\nupon which\nthis fandom is based had already been widely read for over twenty years, the\nsudden and geometric growth of internet chat in the 80s and 90s allowed\nvirtually anyone to assume the role of a Gorean slave master anonymously and,\nfor the most part, unchallenged. To muddy the waters\neven further, many of these role players, drunk with their very first taste of\npower over another human being, deliberately set out to blur the lines between\ntheir role play activities and real life by concealing their ages, experience levels,\nand the fact that most of them were still in high school. As a result, an\nastonishingly large number of curious and bored middle-aged housewives were\nsucked into the charade, and suddenly found themselves slaves to deceptive and\nsadistic teenagers who, more often than not, had never read a single page of any\nof John Norman’s 32 Gor novels.\nIt would not be unreasonable to assume that many of the teenaged Gorean\n“Masters” had never even had a real girlfriend prior to becoming the proud\nowners of actual women who fancied themselves Gorean slave girls.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1963,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dvHKpObmdQUn8osYBtx8YZOCPLfkIgLBBTSUVa/zfHU="},"cbe6c37b-1193-410b-9114-ce1dd30e8546":{"id_":"cbe6c37b-1193-410b-9114-ce1dd30e8546","metadata":{"page_number":160,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_160","metadata":{"page_number":160,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"7DVLxO7uoef3GBXQBHOItLpydo68W5rWtRANUQ0wFqU="}},"text":"Unfortunately, this catastrophic combination of rampant deceit, adolescent\nimmaturity, inexperience in adult relationships, and even their rank\nincompetence at role playing over the past twenty years has left literally millions\nof women and the people who cared for them with an intense hatred for anything\nGorean.

Even so, just as there will always be a great deal of overlap\nwhen it comes to BDSM\nand D/s, one should also expect to find aspects of Gor just about anywhere you\nlook in either lifestyle.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1699,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ZsiKnbWMva6aIsIgsSv0w9/uZxSIhFIHeY/4pABXxPI="},"2e398c23-c691-4557-9563-9a464dec0984":{"id_":"2e398c23-c691-4557-9563-9a464dec0984","metadata":{"page_number":165,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_165","metadata":{"page_number":165,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"tlyN80ul5HU0kQ5hr82W4MS/2/YBlU5ffIC8Ji12/0M="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ac6972b5-6767-473a-adae-0318a9f8b190","metadata":{},"hash":"Jk0Pwg+PSgdU471udpGPqwhL0PAtOZSx9oe69Wj8V6M="}},"text":"What Do Goreans Really Believe?If we’re going to discuss what Goreans really believe, we must be willing to\nmake a distinction between what is described in the Gor novels, what is actually\npreached and practiced by those in the real-world Gorean subculture, and how it\nis misinterpreted and caricatured by chat room role players who, more often than\nnot, have never actually read any of the novels.As if all of that isn’t already\nenough to make your head spin, we’ll finish up with some real-life true stories\ninvolving the Gorean lifestyle.Good times ahead;

Gorean Slave\nGorean slaves are categorized in a variety of ways, such as pedigree, virginity,\ntraining and utility.In general, barbarian slave girls are women who have been\nabducted from Earth by the insect race of Priest-Kings on their voyages of\nacquisition.True Gorean slave girls are those who are native-born to Gor,\nwhether they were born free or slave.Pedigree also is a factor when it comes to\npassion slaves and exotics, which are slave specifically bred by a slaver from\nslave stock to perpetuate desired traits and attributes.Virginity, to absolutely no one’s surprise, is a big deal on the planet Gor.A\nfemale slave who is a virgin is referred to as a “white silk girl.”A female slave\nwho is not a virgin is referred to as a “red silk girl.”The distinction is largely\nsemantic and ceremonial, as it is neither required, nor even customary, for white\nsilk girls to wear only white, or red silk girls to wear only red.It is, however,\ncommon for the appropriate colors to be worn for special occasions, ceremonial\npurposes, and sometimes for a number of days following those events.Slaves are also categorized by the types of training they have received.For\nexample, most slave girls are expected to know how to dance in order to\nentertain their Masters, however a slave girl of Gor who has been formally\ntrained and certified by a recognized school of dance has earned the right to be\nspecifically referred to as a Dancer.A lady’s serving slave, which is a slave\nwho has been specifically trained in the skills required for attending to the needs\nof high-bred Gorean women, would be expected to know far more about the\nsubjects of clothing, bathing, hygiene, serving, table service, and social protocols\nthan any typical slave girl.A Gorean slave’s training, like her virginity, is also a really big deal.When we\nthink of the word training, we usually think in terms of skills that require\nspecialized abilities or an abundance of technical knowledge.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"DfJjdjrmaBrEBPcRIuGXG1Unmiq3cj3IPAbGvdoshQ0="},"7477aa9a-3b06-461b-97e8-92952c54e35e":{"id_":"7477aa9a-3b06-461b-97e8-92952c54e35e","metadata":{"page_number":167,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Gorean Collar\nA pretty compelling case could be made that we all owe a great debt to John\nNorman for being the originator of the notion of collaring as the Master/slave\nalternative to traditional committed relationships.He was certainly largely\nresponsible for the popularization, if not the origination, of the concept.Our\nEarthly BDSM culture may recognize only a handful of different collar types,\nbut on the planet Gor, a collar has dozens of practical and symbolic purposes, not\nthe least of which are their aesthetic qualities.In Slave Girl of Gor (1977), John\nNorman wrote, “In the matter of collars, as in all things, Goreans commonly\nexhibit good taste and aesthetic sense.\"Elsewhere in the same work, Norman\ncommented on the emotional utility that a collar may have for both the Master\nand the slave:\n“It is said, in a Gorean proverb, that a man, in his heart, desires freedom,\nand that a woman, in her belly, yearns for love.The collar, in its way,\nanswers both needs.The man is most free, owning the slave.He may do\nwhat he wishes with her.The woman, on the other hand, being owned, is\ninstitutionally and helplessly subject, in her status as slave, to the\nsubmissions of love.”(John Norman, Slave Girl of Gor, 1977)\nNew slaves - particularly slaves brought to Gor from Earth - are made to\nmemorize the customs and cultural lore surrounding the history and purpose of\nGorean collars, and are expected to be able to recite them upon her master’s\ncommand:\n\"What is the common purpose of a collar?\"\"The collar has four common purposes, Master,\" she said,\n\"First, it visibly designates me as a slave, as a brand might not, should it\nbe covered by clothing.Second, it impresses my slavery upon me.Thirdly, it identifies me to

of Collars\nGorean merchant law defines a collar as anything that is worn about the neck of\nan individual for the primary purpose of marking the person as a slave, though as\nwe are about to see, they can serve many other purposes, as well.Slave collars\nare not required by Gorean law, but they are strongly recommended.If a collar\nbears markings at all, it will typically identify the slave’s owner, and bear the\nslaves given name.Gorean collars can be made of just about any material.The most commonly\nused are steel, leather, rope, cord, and fabric.Gorean collars, like the slaves who\nwear them, are typically categorized by their utility and purpose.At times, those\npurposes can be so specialized, that some of the collars described in the novels\nwould have no conceivable counterparts or utility on Earth except, perhaps, as\ncollars which are used solely for role play purposes.On the other hand, many of\nthe most strikingly beautiful and exclusive collar designs on Earth have been\ninspired by Norman’s colorful descriptions.As you peruse the following list of\nGorean collar types, see if you can tell which might be better suited for practical\nuse in the real-world.Beaded Collar\nThe beaded collar was typically worn by slaves of the “Red Savages of the\nBarrens.”Many of these so-called red savages, or Red Hunters, were the direct\ndescendants of American Indians and Inuit who had been brought to Gor\nhundreds of years ago by the insect-like race of Priest Kings in order to populate\nthe barren planet.The collar itself is described in the following fashion:\n“She was barefoot.About her left ankle there was, about two inches high,\na beaded cuff, or anklet.Her garb was doubtless intended to suggest the\ndistinctive, humiliating and scandalously brief garment in which red\nsavages are sometimes pleased to place their white slaves.One difference,\nhowever, must surely be noted.The red savages do not use steel collars.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TEIkZ4AUSFgQcqYk/2yUjpd7k395E4Z0oStFDld4cE8="},"2c0f1530-620c-4ca5-8a9d-e48f79e72440":{"id_":"2c0f1530-620c-4ca5-8a9d-e48f79e72440","metadata":{"page_number":175,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

the Red Hunters who are specifically descended from Inuit, their slaves\nand animals are identified by an intricately knotted set of four leather strings,\nsimilar to a collar.These are called bondage strings and, like the beaded collar,\nthe different types of knots used identify the specific owner.Capture Collar\nThe capture collar consists of a loop of chain attached to two wooden handles in\nsuch a way that it is easy to block off a slave's air supply as a measure of\nphysical control while maintaining a safe distance.It was described by the\nauthor thusly:\n\"About my throat, closely looped, was a narrow golden chain.It was\ncontrolled by two narrow wooden handles, in his hands...It was a girl-\ncapture chain...It is to be distinguished from the standard garrote, which\nis armed with wire and can cut a throat easily.The standard garrote, of\ncourse, is impractical for captures, for the victim, in even a reflexive\nmovement, might cut her own throat.\"(John Norman, Savages of Gor, 1982)\nCoffle Collar\nA coffle is a line of prisoners, chained together.Therefore, a coffle collar is a\nslave collar with a sturdy ring attached to it which allows a chain to be threaded\nthrough the ring in order to control multiple slaves on the same chain.The chain\nmay be permanently attached or removable, depending on the number of slaves\nin the coffle, and what they will be doing while chained in this fashion.\"The collars had front and back rings, were hinged on the right and locked\non the left.This is a familiar form of coffle collar.The lengths of chain\nbetween the collars were about 3 to 4 feet long.Some were attached to the\ncollar rings by the links themselves, opened and then re-closed about the\nrings, and some of them were fastened to the collar rings by snap rings.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Gk9xxNqzU0VX2ombFkaSOkxuQ+SscU7yD/WRdQJyCxk="},"b102ea45-b5a6-4c50-aa6a-44dfc7176e7b":{"id_":"b102ea45-b5a6-4c50-aa6a-44dfc7176e7b","metadata":{"page_number":176,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

have\nrevolted, and enslaved their women.These are usually kept in cord collars,\nwith small disks attached to them, indicating the names of their masters.\"(John Norman, Vagabonds of Gor, 1987)\nDance Collar\nThe dance collar is a collar designed primarily for its aesthetic value as\nadornment for Gorean dancers.It consists primarily of a collar with a largely\nornamental light-weight chain attached, which sometimes is also attached to\nwrist cuffs.The design varies from region to region and from dancer to dancer:\n“A wrist ring was fastened on her right wrist.The long, slender, gleaming\nchain was fastened to this and, looping down and up, ascended gracefully\nto a wide chain ring on her collar, through which it freely passed, thence\ndescending, looping down, and ascending, looping up, gracefully, to the\nleft wrist ring.If she were to stand quietly, the palms of her hands on her\nthighs, the lower portions of the chain, those two dangling loops, would\nhave been about

the Gorean Way\nThe traditions and lore associated with the Gorean custom of collaring slaves\nwere described and expounded upon by John Norman as a recurring theme over\nthe course of all thirty-two Gor novels.The widespread contemporary practice\nof collaring as a symbol of commitment within the BDSM culture owes a great\ndeal to Norman’s imagination and vision, even though he never advocated that\nthe Gorean culture should be emulated in real-life.A Gorean collar is symbolic of far more than simply the unbreakable bond\nbetween a master and his slave.Gorean tradition celebrates what they consider\nto be the natural order of things, which includes a man’s inherent dominance\nover women.According to folklore passed down through countless generations,\nthis natural order was the result of an ancient war of the sexes:\n“In Gorean mythology it is said that there was once a war between men\nand women and that the women lost, and that the Priest-Kings, not wishing\nthe women to be killed, made them beautiful, but as the price of this gift\ndecreed that they, and their daughters, to the end of time, would be the\nslaves of men.”(John Norman, Dancer of Gor, 1985)\nThe actual procedures involved in the collaring of a slave vary widely,\ndepending on the culture, region, type of slave being collared, and the collar\nitself.At one end of the spectrum, the process is no more sacrosanct than the\nshoeing of a horse or the branding of a steer might be on Earth, as this passage\nfrom “Marauders of Gor” illustrates: \"Do not move your head, bondmaid,\" said\nthe smith.Then, with great blows of the iron hammer, he riveted the iron collar\nabout her throat.A man then pulled her by the hair from the anvil and threw her to one side.She lay there weeping, a naked bondmaid, marked and collared.\"Next,\" called out the Forkbeard.Weeping, another girl was flung over the branding log.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"qn/z9Fl50AA8vZy0QV7xLbsyAe87sArikdu2Hl+m4rc="},"8c3df6e8-48cb-454a-aa0c-a3b3a3e71214":{"id_":"8c3df6e8-48cb-454a-aa0c-a3b3a3e71214","metadata":{"page_number":182,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

in Real World Relationships\nContrary to popular belief, Gorean relationships not only do exist in real-life,\nthey often thrive in relative obscurity there.The common misconception that\nthere aren’t many real-world Gorean relationships out there is based on a variety\nof factors, not the least of which is the general scorn with which such\nrelationships are sometimes viewed by others.Knowing that your relationship dynamic is likely to become the subject of\ninsults, jokes, or dismissive commentary can have a chilling effect on how\nforthcoming you are in making it public.You might think that being part of the\nallegedly non-judgmental and tolerant fetish culture would preclude this from\nhappening, but that’s not always the case.In fact, it is ironic that the harmful\nmisconceptions about Gorean relationships are far more common and negative\nwithin the BDSM lifestyle than they are among the general population, where an\nalmost complete lack of awareness among the vanilla folk works to the Goreans’\nadvantage.While a significant percentage of real-life Master/slave relationships are Gorean\nto some degree, a “Gorean lifestyle” need not be defined solely by Master/slave\nrelationships, nor should it be.As we noted at the beginning of this chapter,\nJohn Norman’s thirty-two Gor novels painted a complex and fascinating portrait\nof an entire planet, complete with its own unique customs, traditions, and\nphilosophies.Sex, slavery and submission may have been some of the more\ninteresting and titillating aspects of Gorean culture as described by Norman, but\nthey were by no means the primary focus of his books.Gor enthusiasts exist\nalong a wide spectrum of fandom that ranges from the pitifully misinformed chat\nroom role-players at one end, and the fanatically literal triviacrats, who will go\nso far as to speak Gorean languages, on the other.Somewhere, between those\ntwo extremes, you can find the practical real-life Goreans, quietly trying to live\ntheir lives and doing their best to stay under everyone else’s radar.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7ueySZ+GiuKiU8WBbOIO5dSKPXkKgai3RbPX/NFcEak="},"9e5d558c-5c19-4572-a2c5-e871fa5d11fa":{"id_":"9e5d558c-5c19-4572-a2c5-e871fa5d11fa","metadata":{"page_number":187,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Two Cents on Gor\nI admit it.I’ve never really been a big fan of the Gorean lifestyle.Sure, I loved\nreading John Norman’s Gor novels as a teen, but the Gorean thing always struck\nme as a little too role-play and not enough real life, and I’ve always fancied\nmyself as a real life kind of guy.My initially negative bias was no doubt\ninfluenced by an endless parade of teen D&D geeks posing as Goreans in\ninternet chat rooms.I have, however, learned a great deal more about the real\nworld Gorean subculture since then, and become good friends with many who\nfollow the Gorean way.So, to all of my Gorean friends and associates, I would just like to say, I\napologize for once believing that you were all self-deluded, pervy, sci-fi whack\njobs.I now know how misguided I was in that belief.That description probably\nonly applies to about half of you.Seriously though, I do believe that Gor, like\nD/s in general, is a mindset that can be expressed healthily in a variety of ways,\nbut a Gorean friend probably said it best, when she wrote:\nDear Friends and Future Friends,\nPlease don’t lecture me about my lifestyle choices, one of which happens to be\nthe Gorean lifestyle.Don’t insult my intelligence by calling me misguided or\nnaïve because you think I’m living in a “fantasy” world.The Gorean way isn’t\njust a fantasy, it is a mindset and a philosophy.It is a belief in a natural order of\nthings, which includes the inherent dominance of men over women.It is striving\nto learn how to freely surrender one’s will to her Master, and belonging to him\nwith all of my might, mind, and soul.Yes, I am aware that Gor is a fictional planet, the subject of a pulp science\nfiction series by John Norman.It doesn’t exist.I know this.I really am not the\nfool you

laughter and any other sexy, happy “L”\nwords we can think of.The truth, however, is that the real thing rarely lives up\nto the fantasies that we’ve built up in our heads.Some people in

purpose of having a sexual encounter, which may or may not include\nBDSM activities.For a wide variety of reasons, most of which should be fairly\nobvious to anyone old enough to be reading this book, this kind of first\nencounter is almost always a bad idea.Nevertheless, they happen in this\nlifestyle, and it would be exceptionally foolish to pretend that they don’t.If you\nare considering meeting someone for the first time for a sexual hook-up, I would\nfrankly advise you to reconsider.Failing that, I would then advise you to take\nplenty of safety precautions and to keep your expectations realistic.Unrealistic expectations are hard enough to manage in any first meeting.Just\nthink of it as a giant, lickalicious double-decker ice cream cone.Adding a big\nscoop of sex to the already towering treat may seem like an exciting idea, but it\ncomes at the price of making your cone increasingly difficult to manage.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"L+QFu9oZZDnVsorD+9+QK+0RkDS4sHYedjQRrycAktA="},"e7a602d1-d4bb-45c8-8de6-4cedf011af02":{"id_":"e7a602d1-d4bb-45c8-8de6-4cedf011af02","metadata":{"page_number":201,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Meeting\nA transitional first meeting is one that is planned for the express purpose of\ntaking an online relationship to the next level.It doesn’t necessarily mean that a\n24-7 life together under the same roof is about to commence immediately but,\nfor many, it does constitute a necessary first step towards that goal.It is an\nacknowledgment that the nature of the relationship is about to change, and that\nyou are both willing to accept a greater degree of risk in hopes of reaping greater\nrewards as a result.A true transitional first meeting assumes that you already know each other quite\nwell, and that you have discussed your mutual goals and possible plans for the\nfuture.Despite the fact that you are already well-acquainted and have a\nfoundational relationship from which to work, your expectations for a meeting\nlike this still need to be managed.The odds may be skewed more to your favor\nas a result of your preparation, but there is still a lot that can go wrong,\nparticularly if you are expecting it to be all rainbows and unicorns.Much of what we said earlier regarding hook-up first meetings applies equally to\ntransitional first meetings.Be sure to give yourselves plenty of time to get\ncomfortable with each other on a variety of levels, and expect to hit a few bumps\nin the road.Surprises, when they are met with the proper attitude and

Considerations\nThere are plenty of factors which should be taken into consideration if you’re\nplanning a first meeting of any kind, and especially if your budding relationship\nfalls outside the boundaries of what might be\nconsidered a vanilla connection. The most important, of course, should be safety\nconsiderations, and we’ll cover them at length in the next section. Before we do\nthat, let’s discuss timing, expense, settings,\ndistractions, and some of the other practical considerations you should include in\nyour plan.\nTiming, as they say, is everything. The timing of a first meeting should be\ncommensurate with its purpose. It may never be too early for an acquainting\nfirst meeting, but a hook-up or transitional first meeting that happens too early in\na relationship could be a disaster. There are\nother timing considerations that you might not think to include in your\nplanning, but can definitely spell the difference between a successful meeting\nand an epic failure. Take, for example, the timing of a woman’s menstrual\ncycle. By failing to take something like that into account while coordinating\nyour kinky weekend together, you could inadvertently be\nthrowing a monkey wrench into your well-laid plans.\nExpense is one of those considerations that we don’t really like to have to think\nabout, but are forced to by the harsh realities of life.\nFactoring the expense of a meeting into your plan should go beyond simply\ndeciding whether you can afford to do it or not. It’s obviously not going to be an\nissue of any real significance if your meeting is local and can be accomplished at\nminimal or no expense. But if there’s going to\nbe any travel involved, things begin to get a little more complicated.\nYou may be able to afford to do it, but the question that you should really be","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1804,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"cZ3U0HmBVPbXAmaTi6r+/o8mADLOSevNJ+vy3w59bl0="},"1fb1b9f6-1369-4808-8650-a21edf677dbc":{"id_":"1fb1b9f6-1369-4808-8650-a21edf677dbc","metadata":{"page_number":206,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_206","metadata":{"page_number":206,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Bxj+w2BrB4zqWttmFRTxY3+hf08JoT9DwZ8CZwN0Lqo="}},"text":"asking yourselves is, is this the best way to commit our\nresources?

Finances are almost always a trade-off. Make sure you both fully\nunderstand what it is you’re sacrificing in order to accomplish your plans.\nThe setting for a first meeting is another one of those considerations that we\ntypically\njust don’t think about until it’s too late to do anything about it. A\nlittle contingency planning for any likely scenario can go a long way towards\nmaking your experience a good one.\nJanet, a twenty-year-old submissive friend of mine who lives at home with her\nfolks while attending a local college, told me about her plans for a transitional\nfirst meeting with her Dominant, Bradley.\nThey were planning on spending four days together and were trying to decide on\nan affordable way to do it, since Bradley would have to travel quite some\ndistance to come see her.

she probably\ndoes.Unfortunately, there may be times and circumstances when that simply\nisn’t going to be enough.Take, for example, the case of Sheila, who was a hard-working, intelligent forty-\nfive-year-old widow who lived in Pueblo, Colorado with her twenty-one-year-\nold daughter, Debbie.Her husband had passed away eight years previously from\ncancer, and she missed his companionship.Her daughter Debbie was confined\nto a wheelchair due to a spinal condition called spina bifida, and Debbie’s care\nrequirements kept Sheila at home most nights with only her internet chat room\nfriends for company.She had just moved to Pueblo a few months earlier from\nFullerton, California and hadn’t yet made many friends in Colorado.Eventually, through a personal ad and subsequent online chats, she became\nacquainted with John, a successful fifty-year-old businessman in Kansas City,\nMissouri.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8Lpc662o9987LsNQ3+utLmOfTkcIlntY1/DT4hagJrY="},"e5f9a4f5-71ba-4822-82ee-4e42b93784d2":{"id_":"e5f9a4f5-71ba-4822-82ee-4e42b93784d2","metadata":{"page_number":208,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_208","metadata":{"page_number":208,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"l6IV4GV3Wbcnt5xAJQ0Usv4Dd1I5x2yQwn2g1E6gxiw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"28260ef0-3dea-4b87-9e72-6e986348a194","metadata":{"page_number":208,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"8Lpc662o9987LsNQ3+utLmOfTkcIlntY1/DT4hagJrY="}},"text":"John was a lifestyle Dominant who was also a scoutmaster, tee-ball\ncoach, Sunday school teacher, and had even been a member of the board of\ndirectors of a charitable organization that helped the handicapped.As far as\nSheila was concerned, the fact that he was knowledgeable and experienced in the\nBDSM lifestyle and financially secure were just icing on the cake.It didn’t take very long for Sheila to fall head-over-heels in love with John.He\nseemed to be everything she had ever wanted in a mate;

women a small amount of cash so they could return home, and gave them\ninstructions to put all their belongings in storage and return to Kansas.Incredibly, one of the women actually did so, only to

to check on you with a phone call, the next best thing is to simulate one.This can be accomplished in a number of ways.Perhaps the easiest, if you have\na smartphone, is to download and use a free

a\nboring meeting, but it can also be used to create the illusion that someone is\nchecking up on you.That, in turn, could save your life someday.Another way to create the illusion of receiving a check-up phone call is to use\nyour smartphone to call yourself from an internet phone service such as Skype,\nAOL, Yahoo, or Google-Talk.Most of these services have the option to make\ncalls to a landline or cell phone, and though those options may not always be\nfree, they usually cost just a few cents per call.There are also a lot of web sites where you can register to receive free wake-up\ncalls.They are designed primarily for people who are traveling and want to be\nawakened to catch a flight, or to make an early meeting, but they work just as\nwell when you are wide awake and simply need your phone to ring at a specified\ntime.To learn more about these services, just Google “wake up calls.”There’s another thing you really should know about your safety and phone calls.Depending on where you are, and your particular service provider, calling 911\nfrom a cell phone may not always work the way it would if you were calling\nfrom a landline.FCC regulations require that all wireless carriers transmit\nmobile 911 calls to \"a Public Safety Answering Point” (PSAP), but doesn’t\nrequire that the agency be local or even associated with emergency services.Additionally, calling 911 from a landline typically provides the dispatcher with\nyour exact location; calling 911 from a mobile phone provides them only with\nthe location of the nearest

staying alive than they were with looking foolish tended to be the people\nwho lived to talk about it.Consequently, my rule of thumb became: When in\ndoubt or in possible danger, be willing to make a fool of yourself.Trust your gut.Do whatever it takes to secure your safety.Don’t agree to\nanything that doesn’t feel right to you, no matter how much you may want to\navoid being embarrassed or embarrassing the other person.Don’t worry about\nlooking foolish, or about making a scene.The attention you draw just might\ndetermine whether you live or die.When your instincts tell you that you are in\ndanger, do the unexpected.Make some noise.Fight back.Throw something\nthrough a window.Disable your vehicle or strike another vehicle with your car\nif you’re being forced to drive somewhere.If you want to increase your odds of\nsurviving a life-threatening situation, then you need to be willing to put up a\nfight or, at the very least, call some attention to yourself.Looking foolish\nshould be the least of your worries, at that point.No one ever really ever dies of\nembarrassment.An Ounce of Insurance\nNo, you’re not going to find an actual insurance policy that covers first

The Meeting\nAfter the meeting, assuming you both survived and perhaps even had a great\ntime, you’ll probably have some decisions to make.The first should be coming\nto a mutual understanding, if not agreement, in answering the question, “What\njust happened?”It can be awfully easy to simply assume that because you had a\ngreat time that your partner did too, or that because it seemed obvious to you\nthat the two of you didn’t click, that it was just as obvious to your partner.Differing perspectives, needs, and desires sometimes have a way of spawning\ncompletely different interpretations of the same events.The key to doing this\nsuccessfully is to be frank and to avoid simply telling your partner what he or\nshe wants to hear.Considering the fact that what you say now could end up\nbeing the foundation of your future real-life relationship, this is definitely not a\ngood time to start sugar-coating the truth.If you are able to come to some measure of mutual understanding about what\njust happened, the next logical step is to figure out what it means.For some\npeople, a successful meeting might mean that everything changes.For some, it\nmay be interpreted as a signal that you’ve crossed a significant threshold in the\ndevelopment of your relationship.Still others may feel that nothing has changed\nas a result.Don’t allow the success of your meeting lead to a misunderstanding\nthat could undermine your relationship.Conversely, if the meeting wasn’t\nsuccessful, it probably won’t be hard to figure out what that means.You should also be aware of a well-documented psychological phenomenon\ncalled “buyer’s remorse.”It typically occurs after someone has made a major\npurchase, and then immediately begins to wonder if he made the right choice.He worries that he could have gotten it cheaper elsewhere, whether it’s the right\nmodel, color or size, and about whether or not he can really afford it.In short,\nthe buyer is quite simply overwhelmed with doubts about the wisdom of his\ndecision.The very same thing can happen after even the most successful first\nmeeting.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"trenobKNk63cMSCZquOeKnjDw7GRJTngFpTBwMhdODs="},"d9e087cd-19a1-4561-80f8-dace98ea458e":{"id_":"d9e087cd-19a1-4561-80f8-dace98ea458e","metadata":{"page_number":219,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

bottle of your favorite\nwine.Once I get there, I’ll call you to give you the name of the hotel and room\nnumber.”“Yes, Master,” came her reply.After the final leg of my flight and a short taxi ride, I was finally at my hotel.I\ndropped my luggage, and made the call.“I’m at the Holiday Inn, room 216.The phone number to the room is (555) 626-0216.Write that information down,\nand make an additional

If that isn’t possible, the next best thing is to\nenjoy them with a good friend.\nI’m not saying you shouldn’t or wouldn’t enjoy using them with strangers; I’m\njust telling you where you’ll get the best bang for your buck.\nThe second tip I’d like to give you is this: Avoid becoming so focused on your\ntoys that you begin to see people as accessories. A person with a healthy\nperspective thinks, “I love being with my girl; I can’t wait to try out some of\nthese news toys\nwith her!” Conversely, someone with a toy-focused perspective thinks, “I love\nmy new violet wand; I can’t wait to try it out on whomever.”\nIt is, of course, perfectly natural to be excited about your new toys. But do try\nto remember that your toys should exist to please your\npartner; your partners don’t exist to justify your toys.\nThe third word of advice concerns an unfortunate tendency among many in the\nBDSM lifestyle to equate sophisticated or expensive fetish equipment with\nexperience and judgment. It’s natural to believe that because people have the\nlatest gadgets or top of the line fetish\nequipment, that they know what they’re doing.

one of them outrageously\nexpensive, and the other absurdly unrealistic.The\nfirst option is to always assume that toys will come into contact with bodily\nfluids and to fluid bond certain toys to certain individuals.The logical\nconsequence of this is you’ll end up purchasing\nnew equipment each time you play with a new partner, which can quickly get\nprohibitively expensive.The other option involves going to ridiculous\nlengths to ensure that your equipment doesn’t ever come into contact with\nanyone’s bodily fluids, under any circumstances.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lbC9HAmQkPP53YILzbyjKqwnx5BTiRqiU001DajOTWE="},"994d5fd1-536d-4cb4-9f46-122f45896ca6":{"id_":"994d5fd1-536d-4cb4-9f46-122f45896ca6","metadata":{"page_number":226,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_226","metadata":{"page_number":226,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"24qH0ClWZnYxbOngvtrej5n/r9Niam2CI6n1LQEVsq8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f219d5ac-65bc-4e2d-8bea-4841122d28bf","metadata":{"page_number":226,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"lbC9HAmQkPP53YILzbyjKqwnx5BTiRqiU001DajOTWE="}},"text":"The only conceivable way to\naccomplish such a thing would","textTemplate":"","startCharIdx":1986,"endCharIdx":2043,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"11jHKtL1JJcZm5OPe0jSivz21dZMUAzHkfuILsjdyVk="},"549e815d-e799-4562-849c-3adad938fa5d":{"id_":"549e815d-e799-4562-849c-3adad938fa5d","metadata":{"page_number":227,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_227","metadata":{"page_number":227,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"FJWGSDlmiScSii0u+M1Rwa20X/7hNvlX+Kp41G1BGvo="}},"text":"be to play only with fully-clothed individuals.

Gear\nBondage gear is primarily designed to restrict a person’s mobility or\nfunctionality.The most common use for bondage gear is to restrain the arms and\nlegs, however, it can also be used to immobilize or reduce the functionality of\nthe head, neck, torso, hands, feet, and even genitalia.The quality of this kind of\ngear can range from absolute junk at the low end to exquisitely crafted works of\nart at the high end.Generally speaking, the comfort, durability and functionality\nof bondage gear purchased from novelty stores are usually quite low, since those\nestablishments cater primarily to vanilla purchasers who are looking to\nexperiment.For higher-end, better constructed bondage gear, your best bet is to\npatronize the specialty retailers that cater exclusively to a BDSM clientele.The following is a list of some of the most common types of bondage gear you\nmay encounter, in no particular order, with descriptions, purchasing tips and\nsome observations on their safe use.Some types of generic sex toys are not\nlisted here, so we can better focus on BDSM-specific items.Wrist and Ankle Cuffs\nWrist and ankle cuffs are probably the first items that most novices think of and\npurchase when they begin experimenting with bondage toys.They come in a\nwide range of styles, designs and materials and can range in cost and quality\nfrom “pretty, but completely non-functional” to “made-to-order\nawesomeness.”Typical wrist or ankle cuff designs consist of quality heavy-\nduty leather, stainless steel buckles for adjustments, and one or more D-rings to\nfacilitate attachments.Some of the signs of an inferior product are poor leather\nquality, the use of non-colorfast dyes in the leather or other materials, flimsy or\nsloppy construction with sharp or rough edges, plastic or coated aluminum D-\nrings, or any disclaimer that states the product is “for novelty use only.”That’s\nmarketing-weasel-speak which, in plain English means, “you shouldn’t expect\nthis product to actually function.”","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"GzR5TsrvU6ZcKFUsDlaW/5BzzN1fUP7yvA45BseiBWM="},"edcc6387-0687-46d6-8705-6e96a462a0aa":{"id_":"edcc6387-0687-46d6-8705-6e96a462a0aa","metadata":{"page_number":229,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

person’s body into a position that causes\ndifficulty in breathing, or postural asphyxiation - another good reason for\nmaintaining that continuous supervision.Finally, it is extremely rare for wrist or\nankle cuffs to be designed to bear any significant portion of a person’s body\nweight.While it might be a wonderful fantasy to suspend a person by their\nwrists or ankles, it is almost always a

or other connectors, a collar can easily be attached to furnishings\nand equipment, or even to a person’s own limbs in such a fashion that it forces\nthe Bottom to assume a posture or position desired by the Top.As for design and product quality, many of the same considerations we\ndiscussed in relation to wrist and ankle cuffs apply equally to collars.Safety\nconsiderations, however, deserve significantly more attention when it comes to\ncollars, since the human neck is particularly vulnerable and the potential\nconsequences of a mistake can be absolutely

the\nfetish crowd, and can be somewhat pricy, ranging anywhere from $150 to $400,\ndepending on the materials and quality of construction.There are some real advantages to using sleeves.First, sleeves immobilize the\narms in a way that wrist cuffs simply cannot.Wrist cuffs may be good at\nkeeping a person’s wrists together, but a flexible person will always still have\nplenty of room for movement.Second, sleeves take a great deal of stress off the\nwrists themselves, transferring and distributing most of the stress to the entire\nlength of the arms, instead.This greatly reduces the chances of unintended pain\nor injury to the wrists.Third, sleeves with multiple straps, D-rings or other\nattachment points along their lengths provide a multitude of ways to integrate the\nimmobilization of the arms into your overall bondage scene, and gives you more\ncontrol of a Bottom’s posture and positioning.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"z3bHdG/UHrbH3zOJU6/SY3JkHOgeEWaR3R7GOqGKT2k="},"5ea086e3-0bce-42e0-99ad-fdc2da51689c":{"id_":"5ea086e3-0bce-42e0-99ad-fdc2da51689c","metadata":{"page_number":232,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

dildo harness, which is usually (but not always) worn around the hips and\ngroin and is designed to hold a dildo in place for pegging.Other common types\nof harnesses include cock and ball torture harnesses, chastity harnesses, purely\ndecorative body harnesses, and specialty bondage harnesses.Some harnesses\nare designed to be used only with other types of equipment, fetish furniture,\nframes, hoists, swings or devices.In short, a harness can refer to damn near\nanything that attaches your body to something else.Straitjackets\nStraitjackets have come a long, long way in the past few decades.The boring\nbut classic beige canvas straitjacket that most of us have seen only in the movies\nhas recently been joined by a wide assortment of new straitjacket designs in all-\nnew materials and hot new colors.The classic straitjacket consists of a canvas\ngarment top that closes in the back and has overly long sleeves which, when\nworn, are crossed over the chest and then tied or buckled in the back, which\nprevents the wearer from using his arms and hands.The newer designs, which are more appropriate for recreational users, rather\nthan criminally insane ones, are typically made with leather, latex rubber, PVC\nor a combination of those materials.Minor variations in their design can include\narms that cross in the back instead of across the chest, the addition of wrist or\ncrotch straps, breast-access zippers, built-in toy harnesses, built-in chastity belts,\nand sturdy closures or fasteners that will accommodate padlocks.Straitjackets\nmake wonderful conversation pieces, and can always serve as the punch line to\nany joke questioning your sanity.They also happen to be one of the few forms\nof bondage that even vanilla people will line up to try at a party.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gl4m0aRfC1gjBc2Ki8c1LCYpXAarhlT4QNVHCBeGHgI="},"fa4681b2-0ce6-4a29-9e2b-1f3cc74d662b":{"id_":"fa4681b2-0ce6-4a29-9e2b-1f3cc74d662b","metadata":{"page_number":234,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

rope.When it comes to bondage, rope isn’t always used strictly\nfor simple bondage or just as a connector; it can also be used in the more\nadvanced stand-alone bondage art commonly referred to as shibari or kinbaku.Both are Japanese terms which came into general usage in the West in the\n1990s.Shibari refers to the generic art of intricate knot-tying, while kinbaku\nrefers to the erotic application of the same skill.The types of rope traditionally\nused in shibari and kinbaku are jute (made from cellulose and lignin fibers),\nhemp (derived from cannabis plant fibers), and linen (which is woven from flax\nand sometimes cotton fibers), and various new synthetic fibers.The type of rope you purchase for your BDSM activities should depend on what\nyou plan to do with it.For most simple bondage play, solid nylon or cotton\nbraid rope that is 3/8” or 7/16” in thickness is usually a good choice.Solid braid\ncord is often preferred over twisted braid for its ability to hold its shape when\ntwisted into complex or twisted shapes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jZ7k+JGYPegDgWD8NtCgq8ruDKyDDr9VI1W9SuaZxYw="},"611c3959-0a36-4092-a106-63a1bfa505eb":{"id_":"611c3959-0a36-4092-a106-63a1bfa505eb","metadata":{"page_number":235,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

lock-links, snap links, carabiners, or padlocks.For very short lengths of chain which can be used creatively in a wide variety of\nways, consider purchasing several lengths of stainless steel or chrome-plated dog\nchoker chains from your local pet store or big-box retailer.These herringbone-\nstyle chains typically range in length from 8” to 28” and have strong O-rings\nsuitable for

three-\nfoot segment suddenly kinks up and turns into a two-foot length, it could be a\npotential problem.Chain is also incredibly unforgiving.There’s absolutely no\nflexibility in a length of chain, and rarely any padding to cushion or protect\nvulnerable parts of the body such as wrist joints, ankle joints, hip bones, tail\nbones, or ribs from harm.You should always closely monitor the spots where\nthe chain comes into contact with bare skin, keeping a close watch for binding,\nbruising, pinching or any other unintentional discomfort.Another tip to keep in mind when using chain: some people can be very sensitive\nor even allergic to certain types of metal that come into contact with their skin.This sensitivity is common in women who are unable to wear jewelry that is\nmade from anything but gold.In rare cases, even gold of low purity will trigger\na skin reaction or infection; those women can only wear 18k or 24k gold\njewelry.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"WX/lCKBzBPCQZVf3J1u/iX8tX+cO0kjddPo5/r3MUrk="},"18eef5b6-f490-4f5d-a8ec-66e07c4c7fa8":{"id_":"18eef5b6-f490-4f5d-a8ec-66e07c4c7fa8","metadata":{"page_number":237,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

India.And in 2008 in Batu, Indonesia, women who were employed in\nmassage parlors were required by local authorities to wear locked chastity belts\nto prevent them from engaging in prostitution.The modern chastity belts which are used in BDSM play come in both male and\nfemale versions and in a wide range of styles.They can be designed for a\nvariety of purposes, which may include preventing sexual intercourse, oral sex,\nstimulation or masturbation, preventing the removal of other devices or\nattachments, preventing or controlling urination or defecation, preventing an\nerection, or as a harness to restrict a person’s movements.They are commonly\nconstructed from leather, PVC, or steel and can range in price from $50 to\nthousands of dollars.In 2002, a manufacturer in Cape Town, South Africa sold\na gold chastity belt decorated with diamonds and pearls to an English customer\nfor the equivalent of $16,000 USD.One of the more popular types of chastity belts used in BDSM play is the kind\nthat serves as a reverse dildo harness.Unlike a traditional dildo harness, which\nholds a dildo in place to facilitate pegging a partner, these chastity belts are\ndesigned to hold the dildo, vibrator or butt plug in place inside the wearer of the\ndevice, and prevents it from being removed.Another popular type of chastity\nbelt is designed primarily for the prevention of masturbation, and is used by\nsome D/s couples as a form of discipline or in orgasm control play.When purchasing a chastity belt, you should always pay particular interest to\nwhat materials are used in its construction, and whether any attachments or\naccessories such as locks, links, wrist cuffs, dildos, plugs, or liners are included\nin the purchase price.Some designs will only function with

it can also be a potential concern for\na single user if it allows harmful bacteria to be transferred from the anus to her\nvagina.A second potential safety concern involves the prolonged wear of chastity belts.Typically, chastity belts are used for short periods of BDSM play or discipline.Unfortunately, there’s always someone who pushes the limits of good sense and\ntries to keep his sub, slave or bottom in a chastity belt for extended periods of\ntime.This is almost always a very bad idea.While it’s true that a chastity belt\ncan be very good at keeping penises, hands and toys out of the wearer’s crotch,\nit can also be very good at keeping harmful bacteria in and creating the perfect\nenvironment for serious bacterial infections.There are no hard and fast rules for\nhow long is

called a\nkeeper.Many buggy whips and horse whips also fall into this category.Generally speaking, stock whips have a short rigid handle, and a lash that can\nrange from three to ten feet in length.The Australian stock whip is a variation\non this style, and has a longer handle and a lash made exclusively from

& Switches\nWhen most Americans think of a cane, they see a mental image of a rigid\nwooden walking stick with either a curved or ornamental handle.It’s\nunderstandable, therefore, that when you mention the practice of caning to some\nBDSM novices, they typically imagine a scene vaguely reminiscent of being\nclubbed like a baby seal by hungry Eskimos.Fortunately, this misconception is\nsimply the result of one of those subtle differences between American English\nand British English.To a Brit, a cane is a long, thin rattan rod used for corporal\npunishment, and it is this type of cane that is used in BDSM caning play.For all\nintents and purposes, the cane used in corporal punishment is virtually\nindistinguishable from the iconic “switch” that certain rural parents may have\nsent their kids outside to find, prior to applying discipline to their back-sides.The rattan canes used for centuries in Great Britain for corporal punishment in\nschools, the military and the courts never really caught on in American\ninstitutions, possibly because rattan was harder to obtain in the Americas.As a\nresult, Americans tended to substitute hickory switches and paddles to\naccomplish the same results.Today, rattan canes are not only more readily\navailable in the United States, but they have managed to make a comeback as\nimplements used almost exclusively in the fetish culture.Canes are pretty simple in design.They typically range in length from 21” to\n36”, and may have a straight or curved handle.Some variations may have a\ntassel at the end, which allows the user to apply different striking styles.Most\nmodern cane designs draw on a variety of materials besides the traditional rattan,\nto include wood, fiberglass, nylon, plastic, aluminum, bamboo and carbon\ncomposites.Purchasers generally choose the materials for their strength,\nflexibility and

significant part of the caning experience is psychological, and so\nvarying the strength, location, timing, or grouping of strokes can spell the\ndifference between an erotically stimulating caning scene and an inept beating.For most caning aficionados, the sweet spot - or target to which cane strokes are\ndelivered for best effect - is the lower half of the buttocks.Canes strokes can,\nhowever, be targeted at just about any non-bony part of the body, save the face\nand genitals.Common targets include the backs of the thighs and calves, the\nfleshy part of the back or shoulders, palms of the hands, and the soles of the\nfeet.The safe use of canes can be summed up pretty well in a single sentence: It’s a\nlong, slender, pointy stick that is a lot of fun to swing around, could easily poke\nan eye out, and is perfectly capable of turning human skin into something\nresembling raw hamburger.And, as always, you should exercise caution in the\nevent that a caning results in open wounds

usually measuring between 8” and 16”, and made from an ultra-strong\ncarbon fiber composite.The way it is used is to hold the handle firmly in one\nhand while flexing the tip back with the other and releasing it to strike the\nsubject’s skin.The high tensile strength of the carbon fiber rod produces an\nexcruciatingly painful strike that invariably leaves a distinct mark.Depending\non the force of the strike and the location on the body, the mark can last\nanywhere from a few hours to three weeks.As a result, evil sticks can be\npurchased in a variety of styles, some of which feature beads or custom shapes at\nthe business end of the stick designed to leave simple designs imprinted on the\nskin.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"jX58tTL3Mr+O27NTA2R3BLDiai+NG4V3arUVXaQP+ps="},"7db24227-69e1-47e5-81ff-000cb4884013":{"id_":"7db24227-69e1-47e5-81ff-000cb4884013","metadata":{"page_number":252,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

Scarification & Branding\nAny BDSM activity involving needles, pins, nails or hooks which pierce the skin\nrequires meticulous care to prevent serious infections or the spread of\ncommunicable

of which it involve piercing the\nskin with hypodermic or acupuncture needles.Strictly speaking, needles aren’t\ninherently painful by themselves, but the obvious and often palpable\npsychological effects of needle play can make it interesting indeed.Some people\nhave reported endorphin highs and even orgasms from needle play, but how\nmuch of that is physical, versus psychological, is debatable.The most common forms of needle play usually consist of placing acupuncture\nneedles into various fleshy parts of the body to induce or reduce fear, create\naesthetically pleasing patterns or designs, stimulate the nervous system, cause or\nreduce pain, and for other therapeutic reasons.Acupuncture needles may be\ninserted into the flesh perpendicular to the skin or at a secant, where the needle\nis pushed through a fold of skin in such a way that the tip emerges again, leaving\nonly the center part of the needle shaft below the skin.This aesthetic mode of\nneedle play has recently become quite popular as a way to anchor decorative\ncorset lacing to a person’s back or chest.Hypodermic needles are also used in BDSM needle play, though less often than\nacupuncture needles, for fairly obvious reasons.Hypodermic needles are\nhollow, and designed to inject or sample fluids from the body; that means the\nneedle has to be thicker and will usually produce a slightly more painful poke.Some studies have shown that roughly 10% of the population suffers from\ntrypanophobia, which is the fear of hypodermic needles.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/84b5ZF4hUD1tWBFCfoDuquiK3UciA5SdMiJNdN/zrY="},"fb6c1caa-4367-43ce-bf88-7723d2ef3808":{"id_":"fb6c1caa-4367-43ce-bf88-7723d2ef3808","metadata":{"page_number":254,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

the use of common nails, pins and staples will lead to\nserious and perhaps even life-threatening infections.As if that weren’t enough,\nthis kind of play can also cause tissue scarring, nerve damage,

originally designed to be used by medical professionals to test a person’s\nsensitivity to pinpricks.It is a handheld instrument about eight inches in length,\nconsisting of a simple slender handle and a small pinwheel of sharp spikes at the\nend.Pinwheels are typically constructed of stainless steel, but there are also\ndisposable plastic versions available on the market.They are used in a lot of\ndifferent ways, but primarily to cause the sensation of being pricked or to induce\na feeling of apprehension or fear, particularly in people who are apprehensive\nabout needles and similar devices.They are readily available from online\nretailers for $5 to $10.These devices have been around for a long time and have always been very\npopular with the BDSM crowd, but have fallen out of

the age of AIDS in the ‘80s and ‘90s literally changed\neverything, when it came to BDSM.Even so, pinwheels are still a relatively\ncommon and popular item in the BDSM lifestyle, and are generally safe as long\nas they are fluid-bonded to specific individuals, or thoroughly sterilized between\nuses.Fluid-bonding is the preferred option, since it’s always difficult to know\nfor certain whether an instrument has been properly sterilized, and especially\nconsidering their low cost.Cell Popping and Branding Gear\nCell popping is a form of micro-branding that typically utilizes a very hot, thin\nmetal rod or needle to burn a series of tiny dots into the skin to achieve a\ntemporary design, which can often last several weeks.The designs can be quite\nintricate, and often involve the application of hundreds, or even thousands, of\ntiny burns which, theoretically, are confined each to a single skin pore or\nepidermal cell which can sizzle and pop while the hot metal is applied for about\none second - hence the name.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"0sf//5ca1MZ4Kla0CDX+bJ9id46J1WmQ63pcdGtpyKA="},"7a9ca645-9bbb-4417-8416-1be6f001c11d":{"id_":"7a9ca645-9bbb-4417-8416-1be6f001c11d","metadata":{"page_number":258,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

kinds,\nso you can decide on your personal preference.Do keep in mind that shorter\ndissection needles with plastic handles may be problematic, since the handles\ncan melt when the needle is heated.On the other hand, dissection needles\nwithout heat-resistant handles may become uncomfortably hot or difficult to\nhandle over the long periods of time that may be required for a complex design.Thick

while a tip is heating.The\nprocess can be quite painful, depending upon the location and complexity of the\ndesign, but most people claim that it is no more painful than getting a tattoo.It\nwill, however, continue to hurt for longer than your typical tattoo.The skin will typically appear white at the spot where the needle was applied,\nwith redness surrounding each dot, and will appear quite unimpressive at this\nstage.Putting lotions or creams on the marks at this point will only delay the\nscabbing process, and could cause the marks to fade altogether.If you feel\ncompelled to put anything at all on the marks, spray some Bactine or another\nfirst-aid spray that disinfects, dulls the pain, and dries quickly without\nmoisturizing the wounds.Within a day or two, the dots will scab up and, about a\nweek later, they will fall off, leaving a residual dark spot on the skin.During\nthat time, the subject should do whatever it takes to resist the temptation to\nscratch the area or pick at the scabs.If desired, repeated applications to the\nsame spots over time can result in a permanent design.Otherwise, the effects\ncan typically be expected to last one to three months.An

somewhat inflated, compared to similar\nproducts designed for and marketed to insomniacs and travelers.Some features\nto look for may include: shapes that conform to the contours of the face, a\ndurable and adjustable securing strap, quality materials and stitching, and the use\nof color-fast dyes.You can expect to pay $7 to $25 for a blindfold from a fetish\nretailer.Blindfolds can definitely be a great addition to your fetish toy box.When used\nwith skill, they can alter or heighten a bottom’s psychological and physiological\nresponses to other stimuli significantly.Introducing an element of the unknown\n- not knowing what is happening, how it is happening, or even who might be in\nthe room watching or participating - can make even a mundane scene a lot more\ninteresting.The blindfold doesn’t necessary even have to be used just to deny\nthe bottom’s ability to visually confirm what is actually going on around her.A\nblindfold can also be used to stoke the imagination or

negotiation should take place beforehand.Gags, like blindfolds, are simple and affordable kink toys that lend themselves\neasily to experimentation by vanilla and fetish folk alike.Gags can consist of\njust about anything placed in or over the mouth (OTM) or even over the nose\n(OTN) as well.They can include such things as an unpretentious strip of cloth, a\nwide strip of duct tape, a wooden rod, a ball-gag, open-mouth bracing, or even a\npony bit.While it may be tempting to create your own gags from common\nhousehold items, some of those materials may be laced with noxious chemicals\nor be unsuitable for being held in the mouth for any length of time.When in\ndoubt, stick with materials specifically designed to be placed in or over the\nmouth.The most commonly available types of gags are ball gags, open mouth\ngags, and bit gags.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CSIlDouVKmCMQ6rIHWuNf2Vz9gunjq8MJY66TjfEM5g="},"01041af8-d464-461c-b004-c3388ca3067a":{"id_":"01041af8-d464-461c-b004-c3388ca3067a","metadata":{"page_number":264,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

not.Some are designed to keep people from seeing out; others are designed to keep\npeople from seeing in.Most hoods function to limit a person’s vision; others\nmay be uniquely constructed to limit a person’s ability to speak, hear, breathe, or\nall of the above.Hoods may be simple or devious, sensual or cruel, loose-fitting\nor elastic, and they may be secured in place by laces, zippers, snaps, buttons,\nstraps, or Velcro.In fact, since many of the hoods used in BDSM play are\ncustom-made for their owners, it would not be much of an exaggeration to say\nthat there are practically as many different kinds of BDSM hoods out there as\nthere are people who enjoy using them.When shopping for hoods, you should expect the price that you pay to be a direct\nreflection of the materials,

corporate name from the\nproduct’s promotional materials.The Magic Wand is extremely popular with\nboth vanilla and kink users, and it can be seen with increasing frequency in\nBDSM photography and porn, most often in bondage or forced orgasm

male during sexual intercourse.If you have never seen a Sybian, you\ncan familiarize yourself with its appearance and functionality by visiting\npractically any porn site on the web and simply typing the word Sybian into the\nsearch box.Interestingly enough, Abco also produces a high-end male penis-\npump type of masturbation device called the Venus 2000.The Sybian, like the\nHitachi Magic Wand,

7/16”.You might also\nwant to take note of the type of plug at the end of the device’s power cord.Some violet wands use a grounded three-prong plug, others a simple two-prong\nplug.It probably won’t matter much to you, either way, until you can’t plug\nyour three-prong plug into a two-prong socket or extension cord.Prices on violet wands can vary widely, but you should expect to pay $100 to\n$300

want to consider the old\nmaxim, “If you have to ask the price, you probably can’t afford it.”Violet wands are used in many different ways.Direct use refers to the direct\napplication of an electrode and current to the subject’s skin, which arcs to the\nsubject because he or she is grounded.Indirect use refers to the practice of the\nwand user touching or holding an electrode, and allowing the current to pass\nthrough his or her own body before passing it to a grounded subject, either by\ntouch or through an electrically conductive object.Reverse use typically\ninvolves attaching an electrode or accessory to an ungrounded subject and\napplying current in such a fashion that the current will arc from the subject to\nanything or anyone that is grounded.Permanent and semi-permanent branding\ncan also be done with a violet wand, with proper training and the right\nattachments.The most common uses for a violet wand are for sensation or tickle play at lower\nsettings, torture and branding at higher settings, as an igniter for fire play, and\nfor the general amusement and aesthetics of playing with electricity.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"IGC8gnfmPpd13b82t8hH4NbDqPIymBlMAxd26vRgq9c="},"1f5d1b50-f269-4301-8d95-69894359f9c5":{"id_":"1f5d1b50-f269-4301-8d95-69894359f9c5","metadata":{"page_number":271,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

concerns for violet wands are often confused with those for TENS\nunits, which we’ll discuss in the next section.The bottom line up front is, a\nviolet wand is safer to use than a TENS unit, and has an entirely different set of\nsafety precautions to be aware of.Contrary to popular belief, violet wands are\nsafe to use above the chest and on the head and face, as long as they’re kept\naway from the eyes.Even though the wand is kept far from the eyes, contact\nlenses and metal-framed eyeglasses should be removed as a precaution.Violet\nwands should not be used on anyone who has implanted electronic devices such\nas pacemakers, insulin pumps, or chemo-therapy pumps.Additionally, the wand\nshould be kept away from any metal in the body, such as replacement knee\njoints, orthopedic pins and braces, or dental braces.Long ago, these types of\ndevices were sold as ultraviolet (UV) light and ozone generators, but the\namounts of UV light and ozone produced by a violet wand are insignificant and\nshould not be a concern to users.Never use a violet wand around liquids.This includes not only showers, tubs,\nand sinks, but any nearby liquid, including drinks which could spill and become\nelectrical conductors.If a violet wand gets wet, the full force of the household\nelectrical current could travel along the wet exterior of the wand and deliver a\npotentially lethal shock.Do not use the violet wand anywhere near flammable fumes, as the open spark\nwill ignite them, and could cause a fire or explosion.Flammable fumes may\ninclude hair spray, rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, fresh paint fumes, lubricants,\nand fuels for household lamps or air fresheners.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3ExrVhBqU9iIeiwktY41c8vVnf1/PW/ku2ZeH8zsQxo="},"645bd067-990d-4e79-ab87-cb128c398203":{"id_":"645bd067-990d-4e79-ab87-cb128c398203","metadata":{"page_number":272,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

which means the clock is ticking and you only have a short time\nbefore you must reestablish proper blood flow to avoid causing serious or\npermanent damage.Bondage photography often depicts models with tortured\nbreasts in this state; however, what you don’t know is how long they were\nallowed to remain so.Most professional bondage photography requires very\nshort windows of opportunity to get the best shots; being kept in the equipment\nor pose any longer can be hazardous to the model’s health.If you plan on combining tit crushing with any form of impact play, you should\nuse a low-impact toy that will not break the skin.When the breast tissue is\nhighly compressed, the taut skin is thinner and under a great deal more pressure\nthan usual.The effect is not unlike that of a balloon which is inflated almost to\nthe point of bursting.It may be difficult to pop an underinflated balloon, but an\noverinflated one will pop at the mere suggestion of a pointy object.Finally, as is the case with most other forms of breast torture, you should be\naware that some studies have shown that habitually rough treatment of the\nbreasts can result in the growth of fibroids in the breast tissue.Fibroids are not\ninherently dangerous to a woman’s health, but can result in false positive\nreadings on mammograms, and may negatively affect the breast’s aesthetics.Cock and ball crushers present us with an all new and very scary set of safety\nconcerns.The first and probably most common, aside from the obvious risk of\nblocked blood circulation, is cuts, bruises or abrasions.Placing pressure on the\npenis or testicles stretches the skin thin, making it much more susceptible to\npunctures, tears and other injuries.It also greatly increases the risk of edema.Edema is abnormal swelling caused by an excessive buildup of interstitial fluids\nbeneath the skin or in body cavities.The rupturing of blood vessels can cause\nhematomas, which are the collection of blood outside of

of weight play is typically\nless on the weights, themselves, but on how the weights are attached to the\nsensitive body parts in question.The methods employed usually consist of\nclamps or alligator

difficult than it looks.The difficulty arises when a suspended mass\nbecomes heavy enough to force the clamp or clip to slip off of its moorings.To\ncombat this unfortunate tendency, it often becomes necessary to use clamps or\nclips with non-slip gripping surfaces, which usually means teeth or something\nsimilar.This, of course, creates a whole new set of potential problems involving\nthe

who has ever gotten a skinned knee as a child knows that even\na small abrasion can create some pretty intense sensations.Abrasion play\ngenerally falls into two basic categories.There’s abrasion play that is done\npurely for the sake of producing pain or sensitivity in a localized region, and\nthere’s the kind of abrasion play that is pleasurable or even therapeutic.Of\ncourse, most masochists would argue that pain and sensitivity are the very\ndefinition of pleasurable and therapeutic.Similarly to heat and cold sensation play, abrasion play requires little or no\nspecialized equipment or toys.For the most part, the only thing needed is an\nadequately rough surface to rub against your subject’s skin.Examples can\ninclude sandpaper, steel wool, pot scrubbers, cleaning brushes, toothbrushes,\nEmory boards, nail files, rasps, or even your own fingernails.The concept is\nreally quite simple: rub, rasp or scratch the subject’s skin until it becomes\nsensitive, raw, or painful.This can be an end in itself, or a means to other ends,\nsuch as serving as a precursor to impact play, violet wand play, or other\nactivities.A therapeutic form of abrasion play that I happen to enjoy is one that is\npracticed widely in Asia to treat aches and pains, chills, and various minor\nillnesses.Since the practice lacks an English-language name that I’m aware of, I\nsimply refer to it as “coin striping.”It typically consists of having a subject lie\non his or her stomach, disrobed from the waist up.The Top takes a quarter, and\napplies a small dab of mentholated oil or muscle rub (such as Ben Gay or Icy\nHot) to either the coin or to a spot on the subject’s back.Then, gripping the coin\nfirmly, he rubs the dab of liniment into the skin using the corrugated edge of the\nquarter.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tT5bdEQsfjw6ASBua9LzrEUAyftFGRIaEqx8HvJQlys="},"49a19478-f31e-4462-a1ec-1769e94ee6e7":{"id_":"49a19478-f31e-4462-a1ec-1769e94ee6e7","metadata":{"page_number":280,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

will be covered with these “suction cups”, which are typically made of\nglass.The two basic types of cupping are dry cupping and wet cupping.Dry cupping,\nor cupping that doesn’t involve any breaks in the skin, is practiced throughout\nAsia and parts of Europe for its relaxing, therapeutic sensations, which are\nsimilar to getting a deep-tissue massage.Wet cupping, or cupping that involves\nblood-letting, is practiced in many cultures as a way of “drawing toxins” out of\nthe body, a dubious medical claim at best.Due to increasing concerns and\nawareness of the risks of blood-borne diseases and infections, wet cupping has\nseen a marked decrease in popularity in the BDSM culture.Dry cupping, at the\nsame time, has seen an almost geometric surge in popularity.The mechanics of cupping are typically achieved in one of three ways: heat, fire,\nand suction.The heat and fire methods rely upon this simple principle of\nphysics: hot air expands in volume and cooler air tends to contract.Placing a\ncup full of hot air on the skin produces a curious phenomenon - the air rapidly\ncools, and creates a volume of low pressure or a partial vacuum.That, in turn,\ndraws a suddenly purple ball of the subject’s flesh up into the cup, where it will\nstay until the vacuum seal at the edge of the cup is broken.This suctioned ball\nof flesh includes muscle tissue which is pulled and stretched in ways that cannot\nbe accomplished through ordinary massage.If the back is coated with a thin\nsheen of oil, the cups can be moved around while still suctioned to the skin,\nmaking it even more like a deep-tissue massage and spreading the therapeutic\neffects over a wider area.Fire cupping isn’t really any different from any other kind of heat-based cupping\nprocedure, except for the fact that it is much more efficient at heating the air\ninside the cup without significantly heating the cup itself.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JaWAn/IFf+sq8fdlPsmtfxw5RPnDZpw5Zed68r07uYg="},"4aa62fc7-76fb-48d6-beae-f98c262ab4c4":{"id_":"4aa62fc7-76fb-48d6-beae-f98c262ab4c4","metadata":{"page_number":283,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

blades being used to create fear, shave pubic or\nbody hair, cut or scrape the skin, cut away clothing, scrape hardened wax off the\nskin, or to poke the subject.Blades may range in sharpness from very dull to\nrazor sharp, and sometimes two identical blades (one sharp, the other dull) are\nused to first create the impression of a dangerously sharp instrument before\nswitching to the dull blade in subsequent play to reduce the risk of injury.The\ncritical ingredient in any knife play is always the psychological aspect of the\nscene.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/e+88aSqACGHBRIqALRb8pFUnPNit1cbvjPXLdOzHHE="},"df2fb5ab-50ff-45ae-9bb5-097bd1b5a740":{"id_":"df2fb5ab-50ff-45ae-9bb5-097bd1b5a740","metadata":{"page_number":286,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

of\nblood-borne disease or infection from the subject to others, if any bleeding\noccurs.To reduce the risk of infection, the subject should shower prior to the\nknife play scene, and the Top should wash his hands thoroughly with a strong\nantibacterial soap.Knife blades should be disinfected with isopropyl alcohol or\nhydrogen peroxide, rather than with boiling water.Putting a knife in boiling\nwater can warp the construction of the knife and will hasten the oxidation\n(rusting) of the blade.One particularly useful rule of thumb is to treat all blades as if they are\ndangerously

Wax\nHot wax play isn’t just for kinksters anymore; it’s become increasingly\nmainstream in its appeal as both an erotic and artistic pastime.Wax play\ngenerally consists of dripping or pouring molten candle wax onto someone’s\nskin to produce erotic sensations, for aesthetic purposes, or both.The types of\ncandle wax used for erotic wax play typically fall into two categories: paraffin\n(a man-made, petroleum-based compound) and beeswax (which is secreted by\nthe wax glands of worker bees).There are many other varieties of wax that can\nbe used, but they all generally fall into these two categories, differing only in the\nvarious additives that are combined with the waxes to change its properties, such\nas its burn characteristics, melting point, plasticity, or effects upon the skin.Of\nthose four factors, the most important consideration for wax play should always\nbe the wax’s melting point.Pain tolerance naturally varies from person to person but, on average, the wax\nwill feel hot on the skin at around 110° F., and painfully hot between 120° and\n125° F.Anything above that may cause second-degree burns, blistering, and\nperhaps even permanent scarring.Pure paraffin wax has an average melting\npoint between 115° and 154° F.Unadulterated beeswax has an average melting\npoint of about 145° F.Wax and candle manufacturers routinely add substances\nto the wax to change its properties and some of those additives will raise or\nlower the melting point of the wax in unpredictable ways.For that reason, store-\nbought candles can vary widely in terms of their melting points.Candles that\ncome in glass jars typically have a melting point of about 120° F.Standalone\npillar-type candles usually have a melting point of 140° F.Elegant taper\ncandles of the sort that may grace your dinner table at a fine restaurant are the\nmost dangerous of all, with an average melting point of 160°.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HBXHIi4M1NTfVzMV0mJb3TjdupE8mASHp7fFcfH06ec="},"e2d73746-8352-484b-86aa-a08f7b20d110":{"id_":"e2d73746-8352-484b-86aa-a08f7b20d110","metadata":{"page_number":288,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

which the wax\nwill burst into flame.Under normal conditions your wax will never get that hot\nin the course of a wax play scene, but accidents do happen.Keep your molten\nwax away from hot objects,

Given the breadth and\nscope of all the other items which could be considered role play accessories, I’ve\nchosen just a few of the possibilities to illustrate a couple of the more interesting\ntypes of fetish play, and perhaps give you some ideas\nfor accessorizing on your own.\nPony Tack and Accessories\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 BC -\n322 BC) is well-known for his writings on physics, politics, ethics, and logic, but\nfew people are aware of the fact that he purportedly enjoyed being ridden\nlike a horse. Today we call it pony play, and it is an increasingly\npopular form of BDSM animal role play. Ponyboys and ponygirls generally fall\ninto three categories: cart ponies, riding ponies, and\nshow ponies. There can be, and often is, a great deal of overlap between the\nthree groups. The role play accessories related to pony play\nare highly specialized, both in the sense that they are not typically used in\nany other kind of scene or activity outside of pony play, and also in the sense\nthat each category of pony play requires specific kinds of gear or tack, as it is\nreferred to by pony play enthusiasts. Tack that is fairly common\nto all three categories of ponies includes a crop, bit or bit gag, collars, butt-plug\nor harness pony tail, wrist and/or ankle cuffs, bridles,","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1631,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PX1CA3uksE4CPhqR8HbqdiaAOA8Ww3Hj/1e3zA2f0RU="},"d171ca8a-81b1-4589-b4b5-7b0d32813a93":{"id_":"d171ca8a-81b1-4589-b4b5-7b0d32813a93","metadata":{"page_number":292,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_292","metadata":{"page_number":292,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"LxwOo/tz4mWp8y82XyF8qKHWIi6FW1+BJWOyi/v1zBM="}},"text":"reigns, plumes, harnesses, spurs, and hoof-mitts or hoof-boots. Less\ncommon, but still applicable to all forms of pony play are items such as\nblinders, breast reigns, masks, horse-head hoods, hobbles (which limit leg\nmovement), martingales (which minimize head-tossing), polos (wraps for a\npony’s legs), tongue-ties or tongue-ports (for securing the tongue), and\nspecialized\nleather, latex or PVC body suits. This list barely scratches the surface when it\ncomes to the incredibly wide assortment of available pony\nplay toys, tack, and accessories.\nCart ponies will naturally require a cart, carriage, chariot, sleigh, sulky, or\nwagon. As pony play accessories go, these items can be among the most\nexpensive. Carts and sulkies are typically lightweight two-wheeled vehicles\nsimilar in appearance to Chinese rickshaws which are pulled behind the pony.\nChariots are similar to carts and sulkies in construction, being a lightweight two-\nwheeled vehicle; however the rider\nremains standing as the chariot is pulled. A wagon is a four-wheeled vehicle\nthat is designed to be pulled by a single pony or a pair\nof ponies. Replace the four wheels with runners designed for use on ice,\nsnow, or grass, and it becomes a sleigh. Finally, a carriage is considered the\nlargest of the pony conveyances; it can be designed to be pulled by as many as\nsix ponies. Pony carts can be quite expensive to purchase, which is why some\npony enthusiasts acquire the necessary skills to\nconstruct their own. In addition to a cart, cart ponies usually require long\nreigns, and specialized belts or harnesses to which the cart can be attached. This\nhelps to reduce the strain on the pony’s\narms, and allows the arms to be posed or bound behind the back for aesthetic or\npostural purposes.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1760,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"O7Wyv+6lHH+bxDtPLlXc2b7UFRK8s1Sty/wMlVGHsqs="},"5da124e9-31b1-41ac-aeca-0b85783cc8ef":{"id_":"5da124e9-31b1-41ac-aeca-0b85783cc8ef","metadata":{"page_number":293,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_293","metadata":{"page_number":293,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"rY+yC6C7JgxOx+xgfVI6qjyTB1uB0PmwdRCtKObDge4="}},"text":"Riding ponies don’t pull their owners behind them; they carry them and,\ntherefore, typically will require a saddle.\nSaddles may be the kind made for real horses, or designed specifically for\nhumans who like pony play.

Since\nthe human back is not really designed to support the full\nweight of an adult rider (particularly in the four-legged configuration) riders\noften support the bulk of their own weight with their own legs.\nEven so, the right saddle fitted and used appropriately can make the ride far\nmore pleasant for both the pony and rider.\nShow ponies are ponies who are specifically trained to compete in shows.

Age play is widely enjoyed by people of all\nages, genders, and sexual orientations, and can be\nsexual or nonsexual in nature. Age play involves at least one of the people in a\nscene assuming the mannerisms, appearance, and/or attitudes of a person whose\nage differs significantly from his or her own actual chronological age and at\nleast one other person interacting with him or her age-appropriately, if not\nsocietal-norms appropriately. It doesn’t always have to be about role playing\nthe part of someone younger, even though that is most often the case.\nAdult babies and diaper lovers (AB/DL) enjoy activities that involve at least one\nof the partners assuming the role of a\nbaby or toddler still in diapers.

Furniture\nBDSM furniture is a truly fascinating subject, a subject about which I hope to\nwrite an entire book someday.I believe that what makes BDSM furniture so\ninteresting is the fact that each piece is typically a unique, one-of-a-kind work of\nart, often produced by the owner’s own two hands as a labor of love.For that\nreason, there are few generalizations that can be made about them other than to\ndescribe their form and function, but even that can problematic given the\nboundless creativity that is often used in the production of some of these pieces.In the following pages, we’ll take a look at several types of BDSM furnishings\nin terms of their form, function, variations on the theme, and safety\nconsiderations, when applicable.I’ll refrain from attempting to make any\ngeneralizations about them regarding construction material, workmanship,\navailability, or pricing, since practically every piece is going to be an exception\nto the rule.Crosses\nThe most common type of BDSM cross is the St.Andrew’s cross, but it is hardly\nthe only type you’re likely to see in private or public dungeons.The St\nAndrew’s cross, which is also sometimes referred to as an X-frame or saltire\ncross, is patterned after the type of cross upon which the Christian apostle Saint\nAndrew was purportedly crucified in the 1st century AD.It consists essentially\nof two cross-beams in the form of a large letter “X”, with hardware at the ends\nof the beams to facilitate the attachment of wrist and ankle restraints.It may or\nmay not be padded, may be completely vertical or canted, and can be\nconstructed from practically any sturdy materials.Sometimes, additional braces,\nbeams, or restraining hardware are added to enable the immobilization of the\ntorso, neck or head.Other interesting modifications may include suspending the\ncross or placing it upon risers, hinges, or swivels.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mzUTzX0MCb16a/VYA8HsP6Qky7V5wpzi1csZIF6NMWs="},"e12c3754-6fb2-4d38-8b07-320af648b77b":{"id_":"e12c3754-6fb2-4d38-8b07-320af648b77b","metadata":{"page_number":296,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

variations in designs and innovations make it increasingly difficult to know\nwhere to draw lines of differentiation.In fact, the lines have even become\nincreasingly blurred between tables and benches, as well, since many products\ncan serve multiple purposes or are convertible.BDSM benches run a close second to the St.Andrew’s cross as one of the most\npopular types of dungeon furniture.They are typically easy to design and\nconstruct, or to adapt from other purposes, which also makes them relatively\naffordable compared to other types of BDSM furnishings.Unused or discarded\nweight-benches and exercise contraptions can be particularly well-suited for\nconversion to kinkier uses, which can make your next trip to the Goodwill store\na lot more interesting than it used to be.The most popular types of BDSM\nbenches are spanking benches, sex benches, gynecological/medical play, cock &\nball torture (CBT), predicament bondage, electrical play, tickle & miscellaneous\nother forms of torture, and queening

to\nbe ideal for CBT, gynecological examination play, forced orgasm or orgasm\ndenial play, or any other type of activity that depends upon unfettered access to\nthe restrained bottom’s genitalia.Sex benches can come in a variety of forms,\nincluding simple short bondage benches, gynecological exam chairs, birthing\nchairs, leg-spreaders, and modified horizontal crosses.Any bench that doesn’t specifically fall into one of the two categories above can\nproperly and generically be categorized as a bondage bench and used in an\nunlimited number of kinky ways, limited only by your perverse

allows ready access to a seated person’s bare\ngenitals to the person lying on his or her back below.It is used primarily for\nforced cunnilingus, or face sitting.An interesting variation on the queening\nstool design is the smotherbox, which works just like a queening stool, but\nconsists of a box specifically designed to restrain and position the bottom’s head\nin the proper position for forced oral sex.Suspension Frames & Hoists\nSuspension frames and hoists are a handy thing to have around if you want to lift\nor suspend your bottom, raise specific limbs or body parts, or place your subject\ninto an elevated position for predicament bondage.Most homes are simply not\nbuilt to support any significant weight from the ceiling and, even when they are,\nnot everyone wants to

rollers tight to put excruciating tension on the arms and legs.Often, the person would be held immobile on the rack by the tension while other\nforms of torture, such as whipping, burning, or cutting

aesthetics as for their functionality.They\ncan range in size from coffee-table-sized to bedroom-sized, and their purposes\ncan run the gamut from comfort space to punishment place, and everything in-\nbetween.They don’t even necessarily have to be constructed in the traditional\nbox-shaped way, either.Some cages are built to conform to the size and shape\nof the human body, making any movement within in almost impossible, or tall\nand narrow, making it impossible to sit or lie down.Others are built specifically\nto be hoisted into the air, and may even expand or contract in size and shape as\nthey are.There are cages constructed entirely of netting, heavy-gage wire or\nchain mesh and, though it’s technically not a cage, an entire room can be\ntransformed into a virtual cage by installing a jail-cell-type barred door at the\nentrance.Some cages are built to punish, others are built as a comfortable\nrefuge and emotional happy-place.A cage stokes our emotions and\nimaginations wonderfully, regardless of whether you are inside looking out, or\noutside looking in.The possibilities are truly limitless and bound only by your\nimagination and budget.The safety issues surrounding cages are typically a bit subtler than they are for\nother types of BDSM play, but are critical, nevertheless.Always be sure that\ncages are secured when not in use and do not become a temptation for children\nto play in or around.If the cage is lockable, be certain to have at least one or\nmore spare keys kept where they can be located in an emergency or in the event\na

We could easily fill several books with endlessly\nfascinating toy talk, but that would probably be counter-productive. We can\nsometimes risk doing much the same sort of thing in our D/s relationships and\nBDSM activities. There’s no doubt that BDSM toys can be a lot of fun.\nSometimes, they can be so much fun that we are tempted to forget that they are\nsupposed to be a means to an end, and not an end in themselves. The toys are\nthere to please your partner and give you both a measure of mutual enjoyment;\nyour partner shouldn’t be there just to give you an excuse to use your toys.\nThere was a time in my life, long ago, when I was all about the toys. Believe\nme; I totally understand where your head is at if that’s where you are right now\nor if that’s where you’re headed. I not only had to have all the latest and finest\ntoys, but I eventually built an entire business around fetish toys and equipment.\nIn the final analysis, however, they were just things. Perhaps my perspective is a\ntad simplistic, but I believe fun is meant to be shared. I have a really nice set of\nskis, but I don’t enjoy skiing alone. I’ve got an awesome racquetball racket, but\nhitting the ball against the wall gets old fast. I’ve travelled all over the world -\nsometimes with, and sometimes without a partner. I’m sure I don’t have to tell\nyou which was more enjoyable. The BDSM lifestyle is no different. It’s simply\nmore fun when you can share it with someone special, and that’s why I’ve\nwritten this book.\nI’m hoping you’ll look beyond the toys and focus a little more on your\nplaymates.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1768,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tSnZzs4KJfAdxvQuCZvVvTJjPwWMhtRql8ldVzCisyY="},"22d1e91a-4a2f-464b-81eb-86852a202b31":{"id_":"22d1e91a-4a2f-464b-81eb-86852a202b31","metadata":{"page_number":304,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_304","metadata":{"page_number":304,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"miKEn0954GxlIGXa4KQJ4oa0eVh0erPgNVCFWtHR20w="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"33e903da-2b48-4c00-8387-f0425c510c2b","metadata":{},"hash":"3HYw69UKi2IlZT+hKQXixugW2FGLfdrbS3zRTPp1A1k="}},"text":"My Two Cents on BDSM Toys\nThe year was 1980, and I was a young soldier, stationed at Fort Lewis,\nWashington as a Forward Observer in the 2/75th Infantry (Ranger) Battalion.I\nmet and became involved with a young lady in town who enjoyed going to\nstorage unit auctions each week and, eventually, I was cajoled into attending a\nfew.To be honest, I was usually far more interested in people-watching and\nsampling the snack bar’s nachos and beer than I was in the auction itself.Sometimes, however, the auctioneer would auction off the contents of a sealed\ncardboard box just to make things a little more interesting, and it never failed to\nstoke my insatiable curiosity.On this particular night, the auctioneer pointed to a large, unopened cardboard\nbox and told us that it had come from the estate of an elderly doctor.He claimed\nto have no idea what was inside, and started the bidding at $1.To this day, I\nhave no idea what possessed me to raise my paddle and start bidding on it, but I\ndid.I was the highest bidder at $7, and I left the auction later that night the\nproud owner of a medical mystery box.When I inventoried the box, I found it full of odds and ends, worthless office\nsupplies, some deteriorating medical texts, a few simple medical instruments,\nand a curious wooden box with a small metal latch.I opened it and found it full\nof strange looking electrical equipment, oddly-shaped glass tubes and thick\nblack wires.A small metal data-plate attached to a box-within-the-box\nidentified it as a “Parco Super High Frequency Generator -

Are you telling me not everyone likes spankings?” This is\ninevitably followed by “What am I, some kind of freak?” Hence begins our\nquest to know that we are not alone in our unique perspective on sexuality,\nrelationships, and the universe in general; a\nquest that sometimes brings us to D/s lifestyle or BDSM groups.\nGroups and associations that serve the fetish community exist in almost every\nmajor metropolitan area in the United\nStates. Smaller towns and rural areas can sometimes be problematic when\nit comes to finding a group, but you may be surprised to learn that they often do\nexist there; they simply try to stay under the radar and are generally a bit\nharder to find.

They are not swingers clubs,\ndating services, or brothels. Their gatherings are not orgies, hook-up\nopportunities, photo sessions, or spectator events for the general public. They\nare\nsimply groups of like-minded individuals who gather to share their experiences\nand knowledge while making kinky friends and enjoying their company in a\nwelcoming, safe and non-threatening environment.\nAs wonderful as all of that probably sounds to many of you, there may actually\nbe some good reasons why you may not want to seek out your local BDSM\nlifestyle group.

For example, when someone\nasks, “Have you been in the lifestyle long?” you could respond with, “No, I am\npretty new to it, but I am excited about learning more about it. Are there people\nin this group who do mentoring?”\nDo try to find something to like and compliment about those you meet. This tip\nworks\nwonderfully in just about any social situation, with any kind of group, not just\nwith fetish groups. One reason it can be very effective in this particular kind of\nsetting is because it can help you to appreciate each\nindividual there as more than just a walking collection of his or her kinks and\nfetishes.\nDo be observant and listen actively in order to learn more about the group.\nBeing\nobservant involves watching for the little things that transpire between group\nmembers, taking note of subtle customs or traditions, and especially to how\npeople like to be addressed.

It isn’t uncommon for scenes to\ninclude such things as open flames, knife-play, electricity, or even asphyxiation.\nThe very last thing scene participants need, in\nthose kinds of circumstances, is a distraction. It should come as no surprise to\nanyone that the audience will be unappreciative of any\nindividual engaging in running commentary, interruptions, criticisms, or\nattempts to inject themselves into the scene. If you are so seriously\nconcerned about a safety issue that you feel a scene should be stopped, you\nshould quietly and politely take one of the group leaders aside in a way that does\nnot cause a distraction to others, and voice your concerns privately to that\nperson. Chances are you’ll discover that your concerns\nhave already been adequately addressed in ways that you are simply unaware\nof.\nIf you are planning to be involved in a scene, make no assumptions about sex.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1947,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pUL3HNN5uwNN22Un0Y9/KXF8npqYK+dYxDJi3AhE3MI="},"66cf833b-fdca-4bca-aca9-ae6c5f557de0":{"id_":"66cf833b-fdca-4bca-aca9-ae6c5f557de0","metadata":{"page_number":321,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

hundred other people, never\nassume that things will play out the same way this time.It is relatively common\nfor people who do a lot of scening to develop their own unique and unexpected\nways of doing things, so if such a thing is possible, you should expect the\nunexpected.You should also never presume, just\nbecause certain things may be against the group’s rules, that your new

okay to do\nso.When it comes to their BDSM toys, some folks can be very protective and\noften downright paranoid about people touching their stuff, and there are plenty\nof good reasons to feel that way.First of all, as you’ll no doubt\nlearn when you start to build your own BDSM toy collection, some fetish toys\ncan be really expensive.No one wants to see his brand new $400 violet wand\nbeing handled like a Wii controller.Second, despite the fact that items used in BDSM\nscenes are often called toys, they can sometimes be dangerous in ways that you\nmay not be able to foresee.It’s easy to assume that the knives that a certain\nDominant uses in his knife-play demonstration are going to be sharp, but the\ndangers associated with other kinds of BDSM toys and equipment may not be\nquite so

Yes, we generally\nthink of bodily fluids as being on or in people’s bodies, but they also have a\ncurious habit of being on their sex toys, as well. In the BDSM community,\nyou’ll occasionally hear the\nterm “fluid bonding,” which generally refers to relationships between people\nwho have agreed to engage in unprotected sex involving the potential exchange\nof bodily fluids. A fluid bond can also sometimes refer to a BDSM toy or piece\nof equipment that should be reserved for the sole use of its owner, because it\ncomes into contact with bodily fluids such as semen,\nsecretions, saliva or blood. Even items that you might not often\nassociate with bodily fluids may fit into this category. A simple leather\nflogger might not seem like a logical place for bodily fluids – until you consider\nthings like pussy floggings, and other types of floggings that draw blood or result\nin ejaculation.

under\nthe radar, and rarely go around wearing t-shirts that read “Pervy and Proud!”Even so, you probably have a good idea which of your friends and acquaintances\nis most likely to be connected to, or at least knowledgeable, about the lifestyle.Diplomatically asking them about whether they know of any local fetish groups\nmay just pay off.Who knows, it could even turn into a kinky date for the\nweekend.The recommendation or invitation of a friend is by far the easiest and\nmost reliable way to find and connect to a local BDSM group.Another way to learn whether there is a group in your area is through (duh!)the\ninternet.While this may seem like the easiest and most obvious method to those\nwho are already in the lifestyle, it can be incredibly confusing and frustrating to\nsomeone who doesn’t even know where to start.Googling “BDSM” and the\nname of your town will usually give you about a million results, some nine\nhundred thousand of which will turn out to be porn sites.Most of the rest will\nconsist of classified personal ads, merchants of kinky toys, and web cam sites.The sad fact is, only a handful of websites out there will turn out to be useful to\nyou in your quest to find a local BDSM group.One type of web site which you will find extremely useful is the sort that caters\nspecifically to the BDSM fetish community.Surprisingly, while there are a lot of web sites that make the attempt, only a few\nseem to be any good at it, and even that is

people you meet in them will turn out to be clueless, deceitful or\nboth, and even their locations will quite often be deliberately misleading, which\nmakes searching for new friends and groups in your geographical area somewhat\nproblematic.On the other hand, once you connect in real life and make friends\nwith other folks in the BDSM lifestyle, chat rooms can be a great way to stay in\ntouch.Another method that is not recommended would be to confuse anything having\nto do with the “swinging” lifestyle with the fetish or BDSM community.Most\nmajor metropolitan areas have\nswingers’ clubs, swingers’ publications, and swingers’ web sites which are,\nmore often than not, completely useless even to swingers, much less to those in\nthe BDSM community.While vanilla

Two Cents on BDSM Munches\nThe aroma of sizzling fajitas filled the air as twenty members of our local BDSM\ngroup were gathered together, as was our usual custom, at a trendy Mexican\nrestaurant for our monthly social.We chatted amiably over our beverages as we\nsat clustered around a very long table at the center of the restaurant, and waited\nfor our server to take our dinner orders.To the other patrons of the restaurant,\nwe could easily have been mistaken for members of the local Rotary Club, or a\ngroup of co-workers or friends celebrating a promotion or birthday.As the waitress completed her order-taking, other members of the group would\noccasionally wander around the table to introduce themselves to first-time\nvisitors, or to give others directions to the after-munch party, which we\neuphemistically referred to as “movie night,” on the off-chance that we were\noverheard by the other restaurant patrons or staff.Suddenly, to the surprise of everyone at the table and practically everyone in the\nrestaurant, one of the young women in the group let out a shrill scream, burst\ninto uncontrollable sobbing, and ran through the restaurant in a bee-line for the\nladies’ restroom.One of her friends was quickly dispatched to check on her,\nwhile the rest of us were left confused and wondering, what the hell just\nhappened?A worried restaurant manager rushed to our table to inquire about the incident,\nand we quickly concocted a semi-plausible story about the poor girl and the\nawful panic attacks that she sometimes suffers in public places.He left, not\nentirely convinced of the explanation, but thoroughly satisfied that the scream\nwasn’t the result of something important, like a fat, hairy roach crawling out of\nsomeone’s taco salad.It wasn’t until hours later that some of us learned what had upset the young\nlady.She had recently met, and gotten to know the young man who had\nescorted her into the restaurant that evening.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HjIT/VHhDMsTwA8IZHmPFz9GP2vLlv8gHeUUHUJKms0="},"c17bf497-0451-47e7-a4ed-6599672aa98d":{"id_":"c17bf497-0451-47e7-a4ed-6599672aa98d","metadata":{"page_number":329,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

BDSM for Sex\nRobert D., a twenty-six-year-old restaurant manager in Kansas had always been\ncurious about the BDSM lifestyle, but had never made much of an effort to seek\nout like-minded individuals or a fetish group in his home town – that is, until\nnow.Robert had recently created an account at one of the major online BDSM\nportals, learned about a local group having a get-together, and decided to attend.The munch was being held at a nearby Pizza Hut, which regularly reserved a\nsemi-private party-room for the large group.Robert was familiar with the place,\nwhich helped him to get past his nervousness about going.Robert arrived at the appointed hour and introduced himself to those who were\nalready in attendance.He enjoyed his pizza and listened to the conversations\nthat seemed to swirl around and across the table.The two-hour social passed\nquickly and enjoyably, and at the end of it, one of the group leaders approached\nhim discreetly and invited him to the after-munch play party.Robert hadn’t\nreally been expecting that, but was flattered and excited at the prospect.Without\nhesitation, he agreed to follow his new friend to the home of the member hosting\nthe event.During the ensuing twenty minute drive, visions of decadent, nubile\nsex-slaves danced in his head.Alas, it was not to be.Robert spent close to three hours at the play party and then returned home\nfeeling deflated and disappointed.Before crawling into bed, Robert took a few\nmoments to journal his reactions to his first-ever BDSM play party, and post\nthem online for his friends to peruse

Neither of those statements should come as much of a surprise to anyone.\nWhat might come as a surprise to many readers is the fact that, sometimes,\npeople confuse love for BDSM, or confuse BDSM for D/s. Let’s take a look at a\nfew examples of how those scenarios can occur.\nIan and Natalie were both in their late twenties when they were married, and it\nwas a second marriage for each of them.\nThey each went into this marriage determined to avoid the mistakes of their past\nmarriages, and to do whatever it would take to make this one\nwork. Things went swimmingly for the first couple of years. Then,\none night, Natalie awoke at 3 A.M. to find Ian’s side of the bed empty.\nCurious, she got up and walked down the hall, where she saw Ian in the den,\nmasturbating to internet BDSM porn. Her immediate emotional reaction was\nas if she’d caught him cheating with another woman. She felt betrayed and\ninadequate. Physically, it was as if she’d been kicked in the\nstomach. In that moment, Natalie feared that everything that she believed\nabout her relationship with Ian might be a lie. She was, in a word, devastated.\nThey fought until the sun came up.\nFinally, exhausted and angry and frustrated, they called a truce and pretended to\nsleep for a few hours in separate rooms. When they spoke again, it was\nwith cooler heads, and Natalie asked Ian the questions that had kept her\nawake. “Why couldn’t you just tell me that you liked that kind of stuff? Why\ndid you have to keep it a secret? I am your wife, for crying out loud.

In fact, she had even gone back to the store a few weeks later,\nby herself, to purchase a naughty French maid costume. She later surprised him\nwith it during their honeymoon, since she had always enjoyed role-playing and\ndressing up in sexy outfits. Suddenly, she realized where he was going with\nthis. While in the store, Ian had\ntaken her to the aisle where the whips, floggers and paddles were displayed, and\ncasually asked her what she thought. In retrospect, her answer\nmust’ve caught him completely off-guard.\nNatalie had been physically and emotionally abused as a child, both by her\nnatural parents and, later, by her foster parents as well. She grew into adulthood\nequating BDSM with abuse, and seeing the leather implements arrayed as they\nwere in the store brought on a flood of unpleasant memories. She told Ian that\nshe simply didn’t understand how anyone could willingly submit themselves to\nthat kind of abuse, and characterized the men who were into BDSM as a bunch\nof “misogynists and closet wife-beaters.”\nOh god, she thought, I did this to him.

It is easy\nto believe that this sort of thing can’t happen to you, but it can and it probably\nwill at some point in your life. If you’re very lucky, once will be enough.\nSo, let’s recap. BDSM shouldn’t be mistaken for sex. Sure, BDSM is sexy as\nhell, but then so are a nice pair of red stiletto pumps. There are three possible\nscenarios when it comes to your stilettos and sex: (1) You could wear your\nstilettos without having sex. (2) You could have sex without your stilettos on.\nAnd (3) you could have sex with your stilettos on, preferably at my house, and\nbring a camera. BDSM is a lot like those stilettos. You can have BDSM\nwithout sex, sex without BDSM, or you can have both. I recommend option\nthree.\nLove shouldn’t be mistaken for BDSM. Just because you love someone doesn’t\nmean you will enjoy BDSM activities with that person. Love can encourage you\nto try new things and perhaps even push the boundaries of what you’re willing to\ntolerate. But love isn’t going to change how you feel about pain, humiliation, or\nhard limits on things that squick you out.\nBDSM isn’t D/s. There are many who attempt to weave D/s into even the\nacronym, but there is a difference, and the difference serves a valuable purpose.\nBDSM is what you do. D/s is what is in your head and heart; it is what governs\nyour relationship dynamic. A Top may not be a Dominant. A bottom may not\nbe a submissive.\nKnowing those simple truths can save you a lot of heartache.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1694,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"8yEJrzYHCIlEO/VOR4z3YP3fcOD3I3HXdlAtUnINxdM="},"aa1be42c-a625-41d0-9d23-0a83f3f31208":{"id_":"aa1be42c-a625-41d0-9d23-0a83f3f31208","metadata":{"page_number":346,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf_346","metadata":{"page_number":346,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","file_name":"Domination & submission _ the BDSM relationship handbook ( PDFDrive ).pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"dTGhqqJ6JTtSeJhFBrVe/KIMDi4LnjOV+OvaVQQfBdc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"adca3b7f-b44f-4b51-8624-5c3b14482152","metadata":{},"hash":"EV1cqPi8J3sCBYuFCcr6ZF0vBwnG3+UnSJ/jEakTzTw="}},"text":"My Two Cents on Sex, Love, and BDSM\nI think D/s is sexy.Perhaps I find it sexy because it is how I express my love and how I want\nsomeone to express her love for me, in return.Some people express their love\nwith kisses and caresses.I express mine through a D/s relationship dynamic;

The word is derived from the Latin poly, meaning many, and amor,\nmeaning love. Polyamory is about multiple loves; not necessarily about multiple\nsex partners. Perhaps it would also be best if we establish a working definition\nof love before we go much further on this subject. For our purposes, we’ll use\nRobert A.\nHeinlein’s definition of love, which is, “that condition in which the happiness of\nanother person is essential to your own.” The elegance\nof this definition allows us to sidestep the sometimes thorny problem of trying to\ndifferentiate between romantic love, familial love, sexual love, or any other kind\nof love that can be imagined.\nIf you are one of those people who has a difficult time understanding how loving\nmultiple partners can be accomplished without\njealousy, instability and strife, consider the love that a mother has for her\nchildren. With each new child that comes along, a mother seems to have an\ninfinite reservoir of love to share with each new addition to her family.\nShe doesn’t love her first child any less just because a second child has come\nalong, nor does she love her second child any less when a third one is born.\nEach child is loved for his or her unique and special\nqualities, and while their mother may love each in a slightly different way, it is\nrare for a mother to love one child significantly more or less than any\nother. Do siblings often vie for their mother’s attention, and sometimes\nfeel shortchanged or jealous? Of course they do.

All things considered, most\npeople believe that a child who\ngrows up with siblings reaps many intangible benefits that an only child does\nnot. So why are we, as a society, programmed to believe that polyamory,\nwhich works so elegantly for parents and children, is next to impossible in other\nkinds of loving relationships?\nIn the D/s lifestyle, polyamory is typically far more prevalent than in the general\npopulation for three simple reasons. First, a Dominant usually has far more\ndiscretion to do as he pleases than the typical non-Dominant outside of the D/s\nlifestyle. Second, the D/s lifestyle\ntends to attract people who are inherently willing to swim against the tide of\nsocial conventions. If this were not so, they wouldn’t be in the\nlifestyle in the first place. Third, many of the people in the D/s\nlifestyle participate in group activities within their local BDSM\norganizations, and sometimes develop close relationships with the playmates\nthey meet there. D/s folk are no more or less likely than anyone else to\nbe sexual swingers, however the cultivation of BDSM friendships with common\nkinks makes polyamory a more likely scenario. Let us not forget,\nhowever, that just because polyamory is relatively common in the D/s lifestyle\ndoesn’t mean that people in the lifestyle are any better at it than anyone else. It\nis a profoundly difficult thing to be successfully\npolyamorous in any relationship, D/s or otherwise.\nAny discussion of what polyamory is would not be complete without some\nattention to what it isn’t. First and foremost, polyamory isn’t promiscuity. Just\nbecause someone loves more than one person, does not mean they love\neveryone, nor does it mean they are willing to have sex with just anyone.

A polyamorous person may have multiple\nsex partners, but he can be just as faithful and loving and attentive to his two (or\nthree or more) partners as a monogamous person can be to his one.\nThis faithfulness to multiple partners is called polyfidelity, and a polyamorous\nperson who practices it is called polyfidelous.\nPromiscuity and similar conditions, such as love or sex addiction, occur about as\noften in polyamorous individuals as they do in monogamous people.\nAnother thing that polyamory isn’t, is a value judgment. Polyamory isn’t\nobjectively good or bad, right or wrong. It\nis simply a description of how some people think, feel, and love.\nYou are either polyamorous, or you are not. It is virtually impossible to\nturn a monogamist into a polyamorist, and vice versa. Yes, there are things that\na person can learn that can make polyamory easier or more viable for someone\nwho has polyamorous feelings, but doesn’t yet possess the skills\nand knowledge to make it work in their relationship, but you simply cannot turn\na monogamous brain into a poly one.

Marriage and Polygamy\nPolygamy is simply polyamory applied to the institution of marriage.There are\nthree types of polygamy: Polygyny, polyandry, and group or plural marriages.Polygyny is defined as a man having multiple wives.Polyandry describes a\nwoman with multiple husbands.Group or plural marriages are umbrella terms\nused to describe any marriages or relationships resembling marriages that have\nmore than two partners.Plural marriages have been around, in one form or another, throughout human\nhistory.About half of the over 1200 societies listed in the Ethnographic Atlas\nCodebook have a significant incidence of plural marriages occurring in them.In\nmost of those cultures, plural marriages are relatively rare, even when accepted\nand legal.In modern times, polygamous marriages have been practiced and\nlegally recognized in Tibet, Thailand, Burma, Sri Lanka, and 21 of the 22\ncountries that are members of the Arab League, with Tunisia being the lone\nhold-out.In Senegal, 47% of all marriages are polygamous, while in highly-\nwesternized South Africa, it is not only practiced and legal, but President Jacob\nZuma has four wives and twenty-nine children.In the United States, polygamous marriages were practiced by the Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as the Mormon Church) from 1832\nuntil 1890, when it was officially renounced by the church’s leadership and\nmade an excommunicable offense.Since that time, splinter groups in the latter-\nday saints movement, most notably the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints, have continued to practice polygamy in isolated communities\nin the western United States and in Canada.Another experiment in polyamorous living was founded in 1848 in New York by\na group called “Christian Perfectionism” which was led by John

polyfidelity, which we defined\nearlier in this chapter.Another concept developed there was the notion of compersion.A simple way\nto define compersion would be to describe it as the opposite of jealousy.Compersion is a positive emotional reaction to your partner’s involvement from\nanother romantic or sexual relationship.The Kerista Commune pioneered the\npractice of modern group marriages; however some of their practices were\ncontroversial, even among their members, such as assigning sleeping partners to\ncommune members on a rotating schedule, and discriminating against\nhomosexuals.After twenty years of operation, the Kerista Commune shuttered\nits doors due to internal strife and legal troubles.Today, there is still a growing polyamory movement in the United States, and it\nis nowhere more robust than in the D/s lifestyle.The reasons for this are\nrelatively straightforward.First, the sort of person who is attracted to a lifestyle\nthat is outside of the mainstream has a higher probability of having attitudes and\nbeliefs about loving relationships that are outside of the mainstream, as well.Second, the D/s lifestyle is structured to allow polyamorous relationships to\noccur more easily, and with greater frequency.Specifically, Dominants are far\nmore likely to be allowed to have multiple partners, and submissives are far less\nlikely to forbid it, than their vanilla counterparts in general society.Third and\nfinally, the BDSM culture encourages experimentation, group activities, and\ncasual fetish play (which may or may not be sexual in nature) that create\nopportunities for polyamorous relationships to develop.There are, of course, many potential advantages and disadvantages that come\nwith any polyamorous

emotion of\njealousy that can become problematic in a relationship; it is the way in which\nthat jealousy is expressed.A simple parallel, to illustrate this notion, might be to\ncompare it to anger.It would be completely unreasonable to expect that your\nmates will never get angry, but it is entirely reasonable to expect that they will\nnever come after you with a butcher knife when they do.Yet some studies\n(White & Mullen 1989, Pines 1992) estimate that 20-35% of all murders are\nmotivated by jealousy!Anyone who is considering entering into a poly\nrelationship should do so with the

potential disadvantage of poly relationships is the issue of\nfocus, which generally falls into two categories: time and attention.It is always\na difficult balancing act to know when to focus these resources upon one partner\nlike a laser beam, and when to broaden your focus to include more than one mate\nand/or others, such as children or friends.One-on-one quality time, which is\ntypically comprised of highly focused attention on one individual, can often\ncompensate for far larger quantities of unfocused time and attention.One-on-\none quality time usually includes, but shouldn’t necessarily be limited to, sex\nand intimacy.It can just as easily consist of any activity that is unique and\nspecial to the individual who is the focus of your attention.The key to\novercoming this

does one recognize\nan individual’s unique qualities, yet still treat everyone exactly the same?Any\nparent with more than one child knows that equity is always an issue that must\nbe dealt with, when it comes to sibling rivalry.The solution typically involves\ntreating everyone fairly and equitably, even if they are not treated exactly the\nsame.Unfortunately, the adults in a polyamorous relationship can sometimes\nbehave like children, by engaging in scorekeeping.Scorekeeping occurs when\nyou feel cheated because another person in the relationship appears to be getting\nmore time, sex, gifts, or attention than you are.Keeping a tally of the days,\nhours or even minutes one partner spends with another, compulsively tracking\nexpenditures, and attempting to quantify enjoyment are all manifestations of\nscorekeeping.Imagine a partner who claims, “Yes, I know you spent all day\nwith me, and only an hour with her, but I still got cheated because you enjoyed\nyour time with her more.”Obviously, there can be no effective rational response\nto an irrational anxiety.Author Erica Jong probably said it best when she wrote,\n“Jealousy is all the fun you think they had.”Odd-One-Out

system that randomizes or assigns seats fairly for all concerned.Children.The presence of children in a polyamorous relationship adds a level\nof complexity and potential for problems that many people would rather not\nhave to think about, but it is a subject that should be given some thought,\nwhether or not the current partners in the relationship currently have any\nchildren.Typically, when a vanilla person hears, for the first time, that you are\nin a poly relationship, the very first question they will ask is “Do any of you\nhave children?”This question usually arises for one or more of the following\nthree reasons.First, they may be confusing polyamory with sexual promiscuity\nor swinging, and are worried that the children will be exposed to orgies in the\nliving room.Second, they worry that having multiple pervy partners in a\nhousehold with kids will increase the potential for child abuse.And third, they\nworry that the children may grow up believing the crazy notion that it’s okay to\nlove more than one person at a time.In defense of your vanilla friends, two of\nthe three concerns actually do have some validity, and ought to be considered.Obviously, polyamory is not swinging, so that issue can usually be laid to rest\nwith a simple explanation of the differences.But introducing any new adult into\nany household (mono or poly) with children increases the potential for abuse,\nand this potential can be significantly higher if that person is, for example, a\nsadist.Further complicating the matter is the unfortunate reality that if any\nallegation of abuse is made, the fact that a person is living an alternative lifestyle\nwill be counted as a strike against the alleged perpetrator in any court of law.Finally, while you may believe that polyamory is the perfect lifestyle for you,\nyou may want to give some serious consideration to whether you want to pass\nthat mindset and way of life on to your children.For some, the answer may be\nsimple.For others, perhaps not so much.The Final

The\nethical teachings of Buddhism include what are called the Five Precepts, which\nare not commandments, per se, but a voluntary training regimen. They consist of\nthe following:\n1. Refraining from taking life and practicing non-violence.\n2. Refraining from committing theft.\n3. Refraining from sensual misconduct.\n4. Refraining from lying.\n5. Refraining from drugs and alcohol.\nThose who wish to further embrace Buddhism learn the Eight Precepts, which\nadds three more precepts to the original five, and transforms the third into a\nprecept of celibacy. The three additional precepts are:\n1. Refraining from eating, except from sunrise to noon.\n2. Refraining from dancing, playing music, wearing jewelry or cosmetics,\nor attending performances.\n3. Refraining from using high or luxurious seats and beds.\nBuddhists also learn about the concepts of Samsara and Karma. Samsara is the\ncycle of birth and death, which is affected by our attitudes about pleasure, pain,\nand suffering. Karma refers to the actions performed by a person, which may\nbring about a consequence or result, either in this life, or in subsequent lives.\nWhile both positive and negative types of karma exist, they are an impersonal\nkind of energy which has nothing to do with personal salvation or forgiveness.\nTwo of the more well-known forms of Buddhism to westerners are Zen\nBuddhism, and Tantric Buddhism (which has become popularized in America\nthrough books and seminars on so-called “tantric” sex). Zen Buddhism is\nfocused primarily on the search for direct spiritual breakthroughs to universal\ntruths through meditation, unsolvable riddles called koans, and the art of\nshikantaza (“just sitting”).","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1848,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MTKDp4RZAoy2+FH6eGc0jysuh16P3pmDrTU/XJV6fHU="},"1a3006fd-ba4f-4842-b1f5-e71759646a87":{"id_":"1a3006fd-ba4f-4842-b1f5-e71759646a87","metadata":{"page_number":382,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

admonition against “sensual misconduct” can be interpreted in a\nvariety of ways, including the strictest possible interpretation, which would be\nthat any sensual conduct at all may be considered misconduct.If that were truly\nthe case, then there would seem to be little point in discussing which specific\nBDSM activities are in harmony with Buddhism.If we assume, however, that\nsensuality in general is not necessarily a bad thing, then we can attempt to\ninterpret at least a few of the Eight Precepts from within a BDSM context.A\ncase could certainly be made that Precept One, which teaches non-violence,\neffectively rules out most activities related to sadomasochism, bondage, and\nimpact play.Precept Four, which encourages truth-telling, could easily be\ninterpreted as a prohibition on role playing.Precept Seven might make it\ndifficult to observe a scene at any BDSM event or gathering, since that would be\nconsidered “attending a performance.”Precept Eight would likely discourage\nthe use of highly customized BDSM equipment and furniture.It would seem to\nthe casual observer that the basic tenets of Buddhism do not mesh well with\nsome of the most commonly practiced BDSM activities.But what might\nBuddhism have to say about the D/s relationship dynamic?Remember, Domination/submission – at least as we’ve defined it in these pages\n– refers to the

and Hinduism: You Can’t Do It Wrong\nHinduism is the world’s third largest religion, after Christianity and Islam, and is\nsometimes referred to as the world’s oldest living religion.It is the predominant\nreligion of India which, in the 13th century, was also known as Hindustan.The\nauthoritative texts of the Hindu religion are written in Sanskrit, and are usually\ndivided into two categories of what we might consider scripture: revealed truths\n(called sruti) and remembered truths (referred to as smitri).Hinduism shares\nmany precepts with Buddhism, including the notions of karma and dharma, and\na belief in reincarnation.Aside from certain similarities to Buddhism, there are\nalso great differences between the two religious traditions.Hinduism can be\nexceedingly difficult to pigeonhole as a religion, since the faith has no codified\ndeclaration of beliefs that are universally held by all adherents of Hinduism.As a result of this lack of a codified and unifying belief system, Hinduism allows\nits followers the absolute freedom to believe and worship as they please.Therefore, almost by definition, a member of the Hindu faith cannot commit\nheresy or blasphemy.Even apostasy is practically impossible, since there are at\nleast two schools of Hinduism (Samkhya and Mimamsa) that embrace atheism!Classical Hindu teachings often refer to the four objectives of life as being\ndharma (ethics), artha (prosperity), Kāma (sensuality), and Moksha (freedom).This designation of sensuality as one of the fundamental objectives of life is a\nmajor departure from what we saw in the Buddhist tradition.While some Hindu\nmonks are expected to renounce most forms of sensual pleasure in order to\npractice celibacy, the great majority of Hindus are free to revel in their\nsexuality.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"tcOVMTgNEmR/UaNZbq1kVytFlJyfhhoKD47SPceHQRI="},"0494415e-b077-4634-9602-1a36a1947c17":{"id_":"0494415e-b077-4634-9602-1a36a1947c17","metadata":{"page_number":383,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

there\nwere, the Commandments are unclear on such things as the penalties for\nbreaking them.Some might be tempted to conclude from the first\ncommandment that God isn’t too keen on the institution of slavery, but then\nagain, Egypt’s enslavement of the Jews in the time of Moses was hardly safe,\nsane, or consensual.The admonition to “have no other gods before me” could conceivably be\nproblematic for any submissive in a D/s relationship with a Lesser God or\nPharoanic Lord as her Dominant.Luckily, she does have a convenient\nloophole.All she has to do is appraise her Dom as being slightly lower in stature\nthan the God of Abraham and Isaac.Of course, getting her Dominant to agree\nwith that appraisal is another matter, entirely.The second and third commandments, which forbid the worship of graven\nimages and taking the Lord’s name in vain, are more or less irrelevant to the D/s\nand BDSM lifestyles.The fourth commandment, however, could become an\nissue if you’re in the habit of engaging in BDSM activities on the Sabbath day.Interestingly, not all Christians observe the Sabbath on Sunday, so perhaps you\nhave a little wiggle-room to work with, here.That is, assuming that wiggling is\nallowed on the Sabbath.Honoring Mom and Dad shouldn’t have to be antithetical to living a BDSM\nlifestyle.If your parents don’t agree with your lifestyle choices, perhaps the best\nway you can honor them is by not rubbing their faces in it.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"wYgM88yB74qJxuy/D0o5m7Plxla0pal69LPC0qoA1nE="},"e9fa3d12-1afb-4eeb-a545-4503d5173c9c":{"id_":"e9fa3d12-1afb-4eeb-a545-4503d5173c9c","metadata":{"page_number":389,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

states that the church should be viewed\nas a similitude for the relationship dynamic between a husband and wife.He\nends this passage by reminding us that the gift of submission should always be\nreciprocated with love and sacrifice.We should reiterate something here, which may or may not be obvious to the\ncasual reader, and that is simply that in this era, husbands were expected to be\nDominants, and wives were expected to be submissives.It was not then, nor is it\nnow, a value judgment of any sort.It was simply a fact of life.In his letter to the Hebrews, Paul expounds upon the subject of obedience:\nObey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they\nwatch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it\nwith joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.(Hebrews\n13:17)\nNot only does Paul again encourage us to submit, but he goes into some detail on\nwhy we should do so in a fashion that facilitates “those who have rule” over us.First, they are held accountable for what we do and second, if we make it a\nmiserable experience for them, it always ends up hurting us in the long run.In\nhis epistle to the

authoritative resource that we should consider in our examination of\nChristian doctrines as they pertain to a D/s lifestyle should be the teachings and\nlife of the Master himself, Jesus of Nazareth.Jesus was considered something\nof a radical in his time for teaching doctrines that were considered heretical by\nthe established religious authorities.A prime example would be the way Jesus\ntook existing religious doctrines, precepts as simple as “Love thy neighbor as\nthyself” (Leviticus 19:18), and turned them on their heads to confound the\nreligious establishment.Jesus taught, instead:\nYe have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and\nhate thine enemy.But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that\ncurse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which\ndespitefully use you, and persecute you.(Matthew 5: 43-44)\nJesus understood the power of love in teaching, guiding, and overcoming\nobstacles to submission, such as pride or

in yourself.Jesus proved the critical importance of faith to\nhis disciples when he demonstrated to them that he wasn’t the only one who\ncould perform miracles:\nBut the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the\nwind was contrary.And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto\nthem, walking on the sea.And when the disciples saw him walking on the\nsea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be\nnot afraid.And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me\ncome unto thee on the water.And he said, Come.And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he\nwalked on the water, to go to Jesus.But when he saw the wind boisterous,\nhe was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said\nunto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?(Matthew\n14:24-31)\nMany Christians are inexplicably unaware that Jesus’ disciples were able to\nperform miracles in much the same fashion as their Master.This retelling of\nhow Peter walked on water is just one of many examples chronicled in the\nscriptures.Because of his faith, not just in Jesus, but also his faith in himself, Peter was able\nto walk upon the surface of the sea just like Jesus.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4ku/vdzXY0OIKCfx5Ng2cW8FjAVXP74TDCYptGAr0sI="},"3bcabd40-2950-4a4c-bd1a-a7feec46853e":{"id_":"3bcabd40-2950-4a4c-bd1a-a7feec46853e","metadata":{"page_number":395,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

can sometimes result in a community-\nwide spirited defense of someone who, frankly, might not deserve it.I believe the answer, for both the community and for its individual members, is\nto examine any allegation of abuse independently and fairly, and to avoid the\nnatural tendency to assume that any accusation of abuse is the result of\nmisinformation and bigotry.In the final analysis, we must be able to presume\nthat consenting adults are going to be fully capable of knowing when and\nwhether they are being abused, without any help from you, me or the nanny-\nstate busybodies.The

chains?It’s not unusual at all to hear someone in the\nlifestyle who claims to be into “whips and chains” to go pale when an actual\nbullwhip is brought out, saying “Oh no, I didn’t mean an actual whip!Got any\nnice, thuddy floggers?”When we hear a term like “age play,” we generally assume that it involves a\nmature individual acting in a child-like role.In reality, age play is any activity\nwhere one person assumes the role of someone any age that significantly differs\nfrom his true age, while another person interacts with him age-appropriately.The most common expression of age play is found in the Daddy Dom - babygirl\nrelationship dynamic, but there are plenty of other possible permutations,\nincluding role play gerontophilia, which is a sexual attraction to the elderly.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"fvxoaRssRaD1iwutWFu1WuGESojf3U68Z8gDa/8xL+Y="},"1089f054-566d-4827-b3d1-2259783878cb":{"id_":"1089f054-566d-4827-b3d1-2259783878cb","metadata":{"page_number":412,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

that you won’t be following them.D/s relationships are\noften all about the rules.Generally speaking, Dominants love to make them, and\nsubmissives love to be subject to them.When one or the other fails to fulfill his\nor her responsibility in this regard, or steps outside the boundaries of what is\nexpected by the other partner, it usually doesn’t end well.The most difficult rules to follow in any relationship are the ones that no one\ntold you about.Being held accountable for something that you’re unaware of is\nmanifestly unfair.Unfortunately, there will always be things left unsaid because\nit is simply assumed that we know certain things, and understand the\nimplications of what we’re doing.One of the things typically assumed by practically everyone in the D/s lifestyle\nis the notion that Dominants, almost by definition, make the rules.If you\nconsider yourself a Dominant, yet are subject to a rule-set not of your own\nmaking, I have bad news for you.Similarly, if you consider yourself a\nsubmissive, yet are telling your Dominant what he should or shouldn’t be doing,\nthinking or feeling, then I have bad news for you, too.Here it is, the awful,\nunvarnished truth: You’re probably far more vanilla than you care to admit.The good news is, I’m told the survival rate for people with this condition is\nquite good.Role Drift, Role Abandonment, & Role Reversal\nWhen

drift is what happens when a partner’s assumed role incrementally changes\nover time.It should come as no surprise to anyone that this sort of thing\nhappens in all kinds of relationships, not just in D/s related ones.The impact of\nthis phenomenon is relatively more severe in D/s relationships for the simple\nreason that most D/s relationships exist primarily for the sake of the\nDominance/submission dynamic.Role drift can occur at either end of the D/s spectrum, and for a wide variety of\nreasons.Quite often, it is a natural consequence of a person’s maturation or the\nsimple broadening of his horizons.It is fairly common and almost reasonable\nfor people to assume, for example, that just because they want to be Dominants,\nor because they happen to be particularly good at performing in a Dominant\nrole, then that’s what they are.Unfortunately, it ain’t necessarily so.These\nfolks would more accurately be described as Tops.A Top is a person who situationally or temporarily assumes a Dominant role as\nappropriate for BDSM scenes, specific relationship or sexual partners, or simply\nas the mood strikes him.A Top may, in fact, be very, very good at what he does,\nwhich is assuming a Dominant role.But that doesn’t necessarily mean that he\nfinds lasting joy or fulfillment in it.Perhaps he assumes the role of a Top to\nplease his partner.Perhaps he continues doing it simply because he is very good\nat it, and it’s really nice to be good at something.Or, perhaps he does it in an\nearnest effort to discover his inner Dominant.Whatever the reason, it ultimately\ncomes down to this: It is something he does, and not necessarily who he is.It is\na role, and eventually, all roles become tedious.Once fulfilling his role starts\nfeeling like work, it’s only a matter of time and opportunity before the inevitable\nprocess of role drift begins.Bottoms are equally as susceptible to role drift, and for essentially the same\nreasons, with one notable exception.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"DMYYIOa0I9aM4KnBZRJzrJItPrhZX9o8Ok3pQz1iX3Q="},"c74985c8-181f-480c-9673-5482942cff52":{"id_":"c74985c8-181f-480c-9673-5482942cff52","metadata":{"page_number":415,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

supposedly\nreally hungry for a boiled frog\nWhen I was first told this story, I was more than just a little skeptical.But then\nagain, my only real experience at tossing live critters into boiling water involved\nlobsters, and they’re not exactly known for being big leapers.They do,\nhowever, make a creepy sound; but I digress.There’s apparently more to this\nhow-to-boil-a-frog story, and we’re just getting to the good part: If you were to\nput your frog, instead, into a pot of cool water and raise the temperature\nincrementally, he will simply sit there like a dope and tolerate the increasingly\nhot water until he is fully cooked, through and through.This is great little story,\nfor everyone but the frog.The moral of it, obviously, is don’t be that frog.Or,\nperhaps, don’t marry that frog.Or, just don’t eat frog.Role abandonment occurs when a partner in a relationship suddenly just discards\nhis or her previous role.It happens in many different ways, and for a variety of\nreasons, but it is almost always a surprise to almost everyone concerned.The\nmost common scenarios leading to role abandonment include such things as the\ntermination of a relationship, unforeseen difficulties in assuming the role,\ncatastrophic failure in fulfilling his responsibilities, or the sudden realization that\nwhile he is role playing, his partner is not.It is, in a nutshell, the so-called-adult version of “I don’t want to play\nanymore...I quit.”Giselle was a petite, ambitious twenty-six-year-old lifestyle submissive when\nshe met

reversal is characterized by a polar shift from Dominant to submissive, or\nvice versa.It occurs for many of the same reasons as role shift and role\nabandonment, but the starkly contrasting consequences of such a complete\nreversal of roles can be jarring or even traumatic to the other partner in a D/s\nrelationship.The depth of the emotional impact that this kind of sudden\nmetamorphosis can have on one’s partners may be difficult to comprehend for\nanyone who is not, himself, defined primarily by D/s roles and traits.In some\nways, it could be compared to how a typical person might react if he came home\nfrom work one day to discover that his spouse had undergone a sex-change\noperation, or had switched her sexual orientation.Yes, it’s that big of a deal.Like any other lifestyle, the D/s lifestyle is defined by what we think is\nimportant.Unsurprisingly, we believe that Domination and submission are\ncentral to our way of life, our way of relating to one another, and our sense of\npurpose and self-worth.Assuming either character trait as a part of one’s role\nplay activity may be a perfectly legitimate and entertaining thing for many\npeople to do, but it makes a terrible foundation upon which to build a lasting and\nmeaningful D/s relationship.Religion\nHere we go again, talking about that thing no one likes to talk about - religion.In the previous chapter, we discussed how religion, for the most part, should not\nbe an obstacle to a healthy D/s relationship or for most BDSM activities.In this\nsection, we’re going to explore some of the ways it can be.In the vanilla world,\nreligion typically becomes a stumbling block to relationships in one of two\nways.The first occurs when one partner in a relationship is religious and the\nother is not.The other occurs when both partners are religious, but their\nreligious views are

profoundly uncomfortable with the\nthought of even simulating an activity that, in reality, would be considered to be\nharmful to others or might cause them pain.Examples might include spanking,\npaddling, bondage, torture, and a host of other traditional BDSM activities.The\nBuddhist practice of avoiding performances could make BDSM scenes, even as\na spectator, taboo.If the Buddhist distaste for being elevated above others\napplies even to chairs and beds, it’s a pretty safe bet that aspiring to become a\nDominatrix would probably be frowned upon.Many people are

defense.In fact, the entire notion of lawful consent is riddled with so many traps, pitfalls\nand legal loopholes, the mere thought of attempting to build a trial defense based\nupon it should be enough to strike fear into the heart of any competent trial\nattorney.We like to think that whatever happens between two consenting adults\nshould be no one’s business but their own, but that’s not necessarily how the law\nsees things.Let’s take, for example, the crime generally known to most people as battery.The basic definition of battery is: the unlawful application of force upon the\nperson of another which results in bodily injury or offensive touching.The first\nthing we should take note of here is the glaring lack of any mention of the word\n“consent.”In most states, the law is pretty clear on this.Battery is battery,\nregardless of whether or not the alleged victim consented to or enjoyed the\nactivity.Obviously, if the victim is the only available witness to the alleged battery, and\nisn’t inclined to cooperate with the prosecutor’s case, then there really isn’t\nmuch of a case for the prosecutor to work with.But there have been plenty of\ncases prosecuted in the courts where an alleged victim has declined to cooperate\nwith the state, yet the case was prosecuted based solely on the testimony of\npolice officers, other witnesses, or medical personnel.Many people erroneously\nbelieve that if an alleged victim “refuses to press charges” against his or her\n“attacker,” then that person cannot be charged with battery.It’s a myth.While the notion of legal consent may be considered irrelevant to the crime of\nbattery, it can be a critical factor to prove other crimes, and in some types of\ncases, it is essentially the only relevant factor.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HHKdPy5ToE29Nv6GKtDmaA3nWp6WJd9RPzh7GbK4rgI="},"3dcb676e-dc39-483a-a98e-252a3ffef7b0":{"id_":"3dcb676e-dc39-483a-a98e-252a3ffef7b0","metadata":{"page_number":421,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

“You totally freaked out.”Whatever.Eventually, her mother (and I) calmed down, and life returned to\nabnormal.But this amusing little anecdote is illustrative of how family can\nsometimes become a critical factor in your D/s relationship in unpredictable or\nunexpected ways.Take for example, what typically happens whenever you tell someone outside\nthe lifestyle that you are in a committed D/s or BDSM relationship.Almost\nwithout fail, the very first question they will ask is: “Do either of you have\nchildren?”The unspoken assumption, of course, is a suspicion or belief that\nyou may be putting your children at risk, or raising them in an amoral or\nimmoral environment.Those misconceptions can be relatively easy for you to\ndiscount or ignore until those busybodies act on them.The fact that they can do\nso anonymously in most cases just makes it all the more dangerous.It is\nunfortunate that our legal system grants almost unlimited powers to agents of\nstate child protective services when they have any reason to suspect that children\nare being endangered, even when those reasons may be entirely bogus.Family-related D/s relationship issues don’t always have to be quite

15: Rainbows & Unicorns\nThis final chapter is about happiness.Your happiness.We’ve spent a great deal of time discussing the almost infinite number of ways\nthat a Domination/submission relationship can go off the rails.To leave you in a\nstate of apprehension, viewing this lifestyle from a cynical perspective would be\nunfair, both to you and to the lifestyle.While this life and these kinds of\nrelationships aren’t for everyone, there is a lot to like about the lifestyle for those\nwho are well-suited for it.Actually, that is an understatement.There’s a lot to\nlove about it.My greatest concern, while writing this book, has been that by describing some\nof the pitfalls to be avoided, that I might inadvertently convince you to avoid the\nlifestyle entirely.I have worried that I spent too much time describing the\nBDSM culture and not enough time explaining how to be a part of it, or even\nwhy you might want to.I have been vexed by the thought that I may have spent\ntoo much time describing different kinds of D/s relationships, and not enough\ntime telling you how to have a good one.I really do wish I could let you peek\ninto my heart and see the wonderful relationships and the lifetime of joy that this\nlifestyle has provided me.This lifestyle ought to be fun and fulfilling.If it is neither of those things for\nyou, then perhaps you’re doing it wrong.I wish there was a one-size-fits-all\nrecommendation that I could give you that would ensure that your future D/s\nrelationships and BDSM lifestyle will always and forever be fun and fulfilling.The key to finding that kind of happiness is going to be different for each\nindividual, but it will always come from the same place.It will come from\nsomewhere deep within yourself.If you’re seeking it elsewhere, you’re looking\nin the wrong place.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2pimKu01s0pAI7Hlm6iB7USndll5drtENrlfwJqhS6I="},"993e5f80-30d5-450b-8933-fd01f8f7fa5a":{"id_":"993e5f80-30d5-450b-8933-fd01f8f7fa5a","metadata":{"page_number":434,"total_pages":494,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\Domination

It is not intended to be an\nall-inclusive laundry-list of every possible kink-related term or toy. In some\ninstances, the terms play, role play, or fantasy may be interchangeable, however,\ngenerally speaking, play refers to an activity, role play refers to a scene or\nscenario, and fantasy refers to something that is primarily a mindset, even if that\nmay lead to related activities and role play.\nIn instances where a word or phrase may have multiple meanings, particularly in\ndiffering contexts, this glossary will always favor the BDSM context and usage.\nThe mere inclusion here of any term describing a BDSM activity should not be\nconsidered an endorsement of it as something that you should try. Many of the\nactivities described in this book can be incredibly dangerous, and should only be\nattempted after proper precautions are taken, and after being trained by a\nqualified person.\nJust because something is listed here, doesn’t necessarily mean you should run\nout and try it. By the same token, if something that you think is important is not\nlisted here, it is more likely an oversight than a commentary on its significance\nin the lifestyle.\n# # #\nAB/DL.

This refers to a fantasy or role play involving leaving a\nperson, typically a submissive being disciplined, in a remote or isolated area\nsuch as in the middle of the desert, or on an open and empty

involves binding the breasts with rope, straps,\ntape, cloth, leather, chain, or any other material to create a sensation of pressure\nor pain.This is often done as much for the aesthetics as it is

arises\non this topic is: Why wouldn’t anyone want to have an orgasm?The answer is\nquite simple: Guilt.Society teaches many of us from birth that we shouldn’t be\nturned on by many of the things that we do find stimulating.There can also be\nreligious, relationship-related, and psychological reasons for repressing the urge\nto orgasm.One fairly common example is the woman who, as the result of

a Top’s hyper-focus, adrenaline,\nphysical exertion, and intense emotions.Regardless of the causes, it is a real\nphenomenon which occurs infrequently, but often enough that precautions (such\nas monitoring) should be taken and aftercare provided, as needed.(See also:\nAftercare, Bottom, Scene, Subspace,

refers to any sustained activity over time that consists of the\nintentional infliction of physical or emotional pain upon another person.One of\nthe key elements of torture is the fact that it is sustained over a period of time; a\nsingle poke or squeeze may not qualify as torture, but a hundred of them over the\ncourse of an hour might.The most common forms of BDSM torture play are\nCBT, breast and nipple torture, predicament bondage, orgasm denial, and\nbathroom restrictions; however the list is literally endless.Torture play is also\ntypically combined with other forms of role play or BDSM scenes, such as\nabduction play, interrogation play and medical play.(See also: Abduction play,\nBathroom use restrictions, Ball crushing, Ball stretching, Castration play, CBT,\nInterrogation

and committed relationship.It is a recognition that, while a\nmore intense and formal relationship is desired by both parties, there is still\nmuch to be learned by the submissive before a formal collar can be offered.During training, every action by a submissive in a training collar reflects directly\nupon the Dominant, telegraphing to all his competence - or lack thereof – as a\ntrainer of submissives.This can also be a period of great stress and contention\nas the Dominant and submissive adjust to their new roles in the relationship, and\nlearn to reconcile their expectations and preconceptions with reality.(See also:\nCollar, Collar of consideration, Collar of protection, Day collar, Play collar)\nTriad.A triad is any polyamorous relationship consisting of three

to the Revised Edition\nIn April 2011, in a cramped and horribly overpriced hotel room in London, I\nbegan the outline for a dating advice book.For anyone who has tried to write a book, they know that starting it is the most\ndaunting part.There were so many considerations, so many ideas, so many goals\nand ambitions.And for a few days, I was paralyzed with all of the potential.But I soon decided to limit myself to one specific aim.I asked myself, “What\nbook do I wish I would have read when I was single and struggling in my dating\nlife?If I had only read one book, what do I wish it had told me?”As the weeks went by, it turned out that I wished it had told me a lot.The book\nspilled out of me in a somewhat involuntary manner, a kind of intellectual vomit.I was touring Europe, giving talks and coaching live at the time, and I would\noften finish up a session with a client or do a Q&A with a small audience and\nimmediately run to my hotel room to jot some of the ideas that had spewed out\nof my mouth into the now ballooning book.I also decided early on that I wanted to make the book different stylistically.I\nhad read pretty much every other dating advice book on the market and thought\nmost of them were garbage.I already knew the core ideas of this book were\ngoing to be different – deeper, more personal, more emotional.But I also wanted\nthe style of the book to be different.Perhaps I was up my own ass with self-\nimportance, but I wanted to give it a bit more of a literary flair.I wanted the\nbeauty and joy of the dating experience to come across in the writing itself.I\ndidn’t just want to lay out step-by-step plans and information to be memorized, I\nwanted to move the reader, since after all, the whole point of the book is that\ndating and romance is

out.See, back in 2011, few pieces of dating or relationship advice talked about blunt\nhonesty, about accepting rejection or even polarizing people for negative\nresponses.Vulnerability was considered a vulgar word among most men and\nanything that didn’t get you laid as soon as possible was often deemed pointless,\nor even worse, being “beta.”And, god forbid, you talk about emotions or trauma or feelings of inadequacy.Like really, who the fuck wants to hear about that, you pussy?Go approach\nmore!But I had known from working with hundreds of men around the world that most\nof their dating problems had little to do with “knowing what to say” or tactics to\nget women to sleep with them sooner.The vast majority of these men’s problems\nwere emotional.They were rooted in deep inabilities to experience intimacy.They were born out of an irrationally negative self-perception that came from a\nlifetime of feeling inferior and inadequate around women.They came from men\nwho were scared to

smile.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XI+AG+TKP3TcuN2XMzxT9SqTVOTjlppis8v1wtp0288="},"691eccdb-e1fb-4d62-8d62-e763d6a1a047":{"id_":"691eccdb-e1fb-4d62-8d62-e763d6a1a047","metadata":{"page_number":6,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_6","metadata":{"page_number":6,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"x+/KIgMXyOpttn5S2OqYT5whKgPgO5pfAC9GlPLGe5I="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d0bcdee1-00f3-4de3-be48-f84d7238a0b7","metadata":{"page_number":6,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"XI+AG+TKP3TcuN2XMzxT9SqTVOTjlppis8v1wtp0288="}},"text":"They

today, I’m happy to say that much of the men’s dating advice industry has\nfollowed suit and is now extolling the virtues of honest expression, of finding\ncourage and confidence through vulnerability, and investing oneself into\nbecoming a better man rather than simply appearing as though you’re a better\nman.Sometimes I get emails from readers who send me videos or passages from other\ndating advice companies or coaches, who five years ago were the king of the\ndouches, who used to wear ridiculous outfits and give “advice” such as whipping\nout your cock in public and screaming nonsense at women.Now, many of these\nmen are preaching the virtues of living honestly and respecting women’s desires\nas well as your own.Often the reader will ask me, “This guy is ripping you off,\ndoes this piss you off?”And actually, it doesn’t.It makes me happy and proud.I was born in Texas and we have a tendency to prattle on about ourselves (if you\nimagine me sitting on a porch sipping a can of cheap beer with a shotgun strewn\nacross my lap, that’s about how writing all of this feels), so let me cut to the\nchase here and answer what you’re probably wondering, “What the hell is with\nthe latest revision and why did you do it?”This latest revision comes on the tail end of finishing a new book to be published\nin 2016.Upon completing that book, I looked back through Models and once\nagain felt that it was in need of an update, particularly in the writing department.I still feel good about the core ideas and advice of the book.But in the four years\nsince I last touched it, my writing has improved by leaps and bounds and my\nexplicative abilities have grown.So, once again, I combed through the text:\nconcepts were clarified, advice was reworded to be more precise, and excessive\nnonsense was trimmed or removed entirely.This version of Models that you are\nreading right now is the clearest, most concise, and therefore, likely the most\npowerful version

they interpret the\nbook, I’ve decided to be more explicit about this.This is a book about\npeople speaking and relating to other people, not obtaining objects or status\nsymbols.Cleaned up a lot of

Quick Note to Female and LGBT\nReaders\nThe popularity of Models has brought it to the attention of a number of people\nthat the book was not originally conceptualized and written for.A number of\nsingle women, as well as gay, lesbian, bi, and trans people have emailed me over\nthe years asking if the book’s concepts apply to them.At first, this surprised me.And then what surprised me more is that as I went\nthrough the concepts in the book, I realized that the answer was a resounding\n‘yes,’ these concepts apply to everyone.Although there are a few caveats.The core principles of the book – Non-Neediness (Chapter 1), Vulnerability\n(Chapters 2-3), Unconditionality (Chapter 3), Polarization and Rejection\n(Chapters 4-6), Demographics ( Chapter 7), Overcoming Shame and Anxiety\n(Chapters 9-10), and Intentions (Chapter 11) – apply to all human beings,\nregardless of gender, orientation, genitalia or whatever.The parts of the book that won’t directly apply are a number of the specific\nexamples and implementations of these core principles.For example, in most\ncultures, men are expected to initiate in almost every phase of courtship,\ntherefore, the anxieties they face (Chapters 9-10), the challenges with\nvulnerability they will confront (Chapter 3) and so on, will look a little bit\ndifferent than they would for a hetero woman or someone of another orientation.As long as you keep this in mind as you move throughout the book and attempt\nto apply the core principles to your own dating situation, you should be fine.Women, like men, must

Movement\nIn our post-industrial, post-feminist world, it’s not as clear as it used to be what a\nman is or what he should be.Centuries ago, a man’s duty was power and\nprotection.Decades ago, it was to work and provide.But now?We’re not quite\nsure.We are either the first or second generation of men to grow up without a\nclear definition of what our social roles are supposed to be and without a model\nof what it is to be strong and attractive men.This book’s goal is to provide that model, to provide a model of what being an\nattractive man of integrity and maturity looks like in the 21st century.That means\ngoing past the standards of protector and provider, of strength and stoicism, and\nimproving ourselves into something bigger and better, something more\nadmirable and desirable.Ten years ago, when I first began helping men improve their relationships with\nwomen, I had no idea the rabbit hole of information and self-improvement I was\nabout to go down, both for myself and for others.At the time, the primary\nconcerns in my dating life revolved around which drink specials were going on\nthat Thursday night and which one of the five Jennas in my phone was the one I\nmet last weekend.It wasn’t until I sat down and tried to get other men to the point where they had\nfive Jennas in their phone that I had a glimpse of the profundity and\nunderdevelopment of most men’s emotional and sexual world and how difficult\nit is to inspire a genuine movement within them to open up that world.I won’t lie, in hindsight, getting myself to that point seems easy now by\ncomparison.Growing up, I had always been somewhat of an average guy,\nalthough I had little luck with the ladies.Then in 2005, after being cheated on and left by my first love, I was emotionally\ndistraught and slightly traumatized.I became

interacted with women, to watch me “in action.”It was weird at first.But then I decided, sure, why not, just buy my drinks or pay\nme a bit on the side.And strangely, I feel like that’s where the real

or dating a “perfect 10” by coming\nup with scripts of pick up lines.These desires are rooted in insecurity and should\nstay where they belong: in your dreams.Rather, Part II is a long-term strategy\nbuilt to take a man from “no women in my life” to “lots of amazing women in\nmy life” as quickly as possible, with as little effort as possible.Part III is the first part of our strategy and covers the first of the Three\nFundamentals laid out in Chapter 6, building an enjoyable lifestyle and\nbecoming an attractive man.The steps laid out in this part will be specific but\nwill be

this.I saw a girl at a club sitting by herself.She looked upset.And when I approached her, she didn’t get any happier.She\ndidn’t speak English and I barely spoke any Spanish at the time.She didn’t want\nto dance and seemed uninterested in talking.She seemed shy and aloof, like\nsomething distant invisible was occupying her and despite her best efforts, she\ndidn’t know how to unburden herself of it.Eventually, through some tenacity, I got her to dance, and then to smile.And\nwhat I discovered over the next week was how unnecessary words actually are\nwhen it comes to seduction.As she and I danced, we touched and played.I played hand games with her,\ntwirled her, made funny faces and communicated with fake sign language.I held\nher, caressed her and touched her hair.We drew pictures on napkins for each\nother.When I put my arm around her and she leaned into me it spoke more than\n1,000

1:\nNon-Neediness\nA man's attractiveness is inversely proportional to how needy he is.The less\nneedy he is, the more attractive he will be to women on average.The needier he\nis, the less attractive

primarily motivated by impressing and winning approval from others.Non-\nneediness is when a man places a higher priority on his own perception of\nhimself than the perceptions of others.A non-needy man’s actions and words\nwill therefore be primarily motivated by embodying his own values and desires.Neediness, therefore, infiltrates all behaviors because it is what inspires and\ninstigates all behaviors.A lack of neediness also infiltrates all behaviors for the\nsame reason.Because it underlies all of your actions and words, to be non-needy\nis to be more attractive, in every way.It defines and resonates in everything you\nsay and do, the way you stand, the way you smile, the jokes you tell, the people\nyou associate with, the car you drive, the wine you drink, the jacket you wear.When people say vague things like, “I like the way he carries himself,” or “you\njust need to believe in yourself,” or, “he just has ‘it’, whatever ‘it’ is,” they are\nreferring to a man’s lack of neediness.It exudes from him in everything he does.Paradoxically, a man’s lack of need for attention and admiration is itself a\nmagnet for attention and admiration.A man’s comfort and acceptance of the\npossibility that some people will not like him makes people like him even more.A man’s respect for differing opinions makes those around him want to agree\nwith him more.A needy man is constantly investing in the perceptions others have in him.He is\nbeing extra nice and friendly when he doesn’t want to be because he believes he\nmust do this to be liked and

it’s not the complete deal breaker that it is\nfor women.To most women, a man with no neediness is like a woman with perfect tits and a\ngorgeously sculpted ass.To a woman, a man with a lot of

needy men will end up in relationships sometimes, but only with highly\nneedy women.The highly needy man is constantly working to earn a woman’s\napproval, and a highly needy woman is constantly in need of a man’s approval.So the two conspire together, usually with one creating drama/emotional\nmeltdowns and the other one endlessly fixing it.This relationship is toxic and\ncan harm each person’s self-worth.Narcissistic men, or men who only care about themselves, will end up in\nrelationships sometimes, but only with narcissistic and shallow women.Both the\nnarcissistic man and woman will view each other merely as ornaments to adorn\ntheir self-absorbed lives.These relationships also are toxic.And these\nrelationships also often end poorly.Now all this stuff sounds nice.But let’s put this into concrete, real-world terms.Here are a couple examples.James is a nice guy.But he tends to be needy in his relationships and has what\nwe would call a high level of investment with any woman that he meets.Whenever he dates a woman, he will rearrange his entire schedule at her whim.He will buy her gifts and spend most of his paycheck on the nicest dinners for\nher.He’ll forgo plans with his guy friends and if the woman he dates gets angry,\nhe’ll sit patiently and listen to her vent all of her frustrations to him, agreeing\nwith her constantly in a futile desperation that she may feel better.Even when he\nfeels that she’s being irrational or treating him unfairly, he won’t say anything\nbecause he doesn’t want her to be upset with him.As a result, despite caring for him, James’s

Seduction Process\nBiologically, women have a lot more to lose than men when it comes to sex.As\na result, they’ve had incentives to (usually) be pickier in choosing their sexual\npartners.Men, on the other hand, have historically had fewer repercussions for\npromiscuity and, from a biological point of view, even gain some advantages by\nbeing promiscuous.Whether it’s biological or cultural or some mixture of both, the fact is that\nfemale sexual attraction is based largely in feeling comfortable and secure with a\nman she meets.Women have evolved a sexuality that is more psychological than\nphysical, and that psychological need is rooted in the need for security and\nconnection.This is why status is based on behavior and not simply assets.A man who is rich\nin assets has greater potential to make a woman feel secure and comfortable, but\nif his behavior implies that he won’t, then she won’t be attracted to him.A\nphysically fit man will imply greater fitness for her children, but again, if his\nbehavior implies he will be incapable or incompetent in raising them, then she\nwill not be attracted to him.Because men value sex more than women at the beginning of a relationship, and\nsexual opportunities are scarcer for men than women, women tend to be less\ninvested and more confident early in on the interaction.When a man approaches\nher and induces her to become as invested in him as he is in her, this is the\nprocess of seduction.Sex occurs as a natural side effect of this process.Seduction is the process by which a man induces a woman to become as invested\nin him as he is in her.There are two ways for seduction to happen: 1) a man creates the perception that\nhe is far less invested in her than he actually is (neediness disguised as non-\nneediness), and 2) a man actually is less invested in her (genuine non-neediness).The first method (a man giving false impressions) occurs through what I

It’s so hard for them to let go of what others\nthink of them and to stand up for themselves. So they go the complete opposite\ndirection and decide to only care about themselves. They become narcissistic\nand self-serving, they view their relationships as vehicles to get specific benefits\nand are unconcerned with the needs of the person they’re with.\nNeedy men only know how to care about what others want, even if it harms\nthemselves. Non-needy men look for that intersection where they can get both\ntheir own needs and their partner’s needs met.

control is due to insecurity.A non-needy man doesn’t try to\ncontrol what women feel about him.Rather he tries to control what he feels\nabout certain women.He understands that the world isn’t about him and that all\nhe can control is himself and his own actions.He’s not bothered when things\ndon’t go his way or when people don’t recognize him as being amazing because\nhe already feels amazing

2:\nPower in Vulnerability\nWhen most men hear the word “vulnerability,” their immediate reaction is to\nassociate it with weakness. In general, men are raised to withhold their emotions,\nto not show weakness, and to ignore any hint of introspection. On top of that,\nmost of the popular dating advice out there encourages guys to be aloof,\nstandoffish, judgmental, and at times, scathing towards women.\nMen have a lot of negative assumptions about the idea of being more vulnerable\nand opening up to their emotions. Chances are it makes you a little skeptical or\nqueasy to even see me writing about this.\nDon’t worry, I’m not going to have you hold hands around a campfire with some\nwimpy support group and cry about your spirit crystal or share stories about your\npower animal.\nI want you to think of vulnerability in a more broad way. Not just emotional\nvulnerability (although we’ll get to that), but physical vulnerability, social\nvulnerability.\nFor instance, making yourself vulnerable doesn’t just mean being willing to\nshare your fears or insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where\nyou can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion\nthat may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of people you don’t\nknow, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her. All of these things\nrequire you to stick your neck out on the line emotionally in some way. You’re\nmaking yourself vulnerable when you do them.\nIn this way, vulnerability represents a form of power, a deep and subtle form of\npower. It’s courageous, even. A man who’s able to make himself vulnerable is\nsaying to the world, “Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to\nbe anyone else.” He’s saying he is non-needy and high status.\nMost people think of a man who’s vulnerable as a man who cowers in the corner\nand begs others to accept him or not hurt him. This is not vulnerability; this is\nsurrender. It’s weakness.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1961,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"AWD4j87jbEm/f7F48K9EQa6lcISNxb/X1gy2aohuSQc="},"a84d6419-558b-4857-8cc3-56ba4046ef47":{"id_":"a84d6419-558b-4857-8cc3-56ba4046ef47","metadata":{"page_number":40,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_40","metadata":{"page_number":40,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"sMYiGclXi9k13R7114Jkfc4odcaQNM4PSc6y4utmtbo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"54bac6ab-dc4c-4151-a469-dbe73aeb42db","metadata":{},"hash":"NFY4KVEKiRgnk3iTXtw+H0Q15H+bn5/KwMuZLfQy08o="}},"text":"Think

after an\nawkward silence, Melina looked at me as if scared by something and calmly\nsaid, “I probably didn’t need to know all of that.”Ouch.She and I quickly fell apart and stopped seeing each other.I was mortified.I ran\ninto her a number of times after that for months and I would always feel\nnauseous with embarrassment.But as awful as this experience was, it was important.It was the

began to notice things I had done wrong in that\nrelationship, ways that I could be a better man and a better partner.But for me to\nget there, I had to be willing to take that first awkward, vulnerable step.Then there was Kate.Kate was slightly older than me and extremely sexual.Our\n“first date” was her calling me on the phone and flat out saying, “I want you to\ncome to my apartment and

interest.And it’s an attractive one.Because when a man comes right out and says he’s interested in a woman, the\nsub-communication is actually, “I’m totally OK with the idea of you rejecting\nme,

to disagree with her, willing to be rejected by her and willing to walk\naway from her if it ever comes to that.This willingness to walk away from her\nand this ability to accept nothing in return is what gives my genuine interest so\nmuch value.When a compliment comes from a man seeking nothing in return, it’s a gift of\ntruth, a piece of his vulnerability and infinitely more powerful as a result.And this honest compliment inspires women to become more highly invested in\nreturn.Paradoxically, seeking no investment from her will inspire her to invest\nthat much more in you.Beautiful women are complimented on their looks often, and 99% of these\ncompliments are given out of neediness, out of some idealization of who she is\nor what she can do for him.Beautiful women have been conditioned for most of their lives to know when a\nman is being genuine or not, whether the compliment is a gift or a bartering tool.And when it is a gift, when it is honest, she recognizes and appreciates a man\nwho genuinely appreciates her.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kBUKifS1cQgjmCdoGzbC4cC4cTp5qr752+16IV28TSw="},"2b209ea1-4a53-4e5d-8006-5325a660225f":{"id_":"2b209ea1-4a53-4e5d-8006-5325a660225f","metadata":{"page_number":57,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_57","metadata":{"page_number":57,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"4SQJLkws3AjwaAGHkSYewbChHoNQWyxSydHse060yUo="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"21890367-8e60-4ef1-94a5-8a81fa717908","metadata":{"page_number":57,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"kBUKifS1cQgjmCdoGzbC4cC4cTp5qr752+16IV28TSw="}},"text":"These

That I’m unwilling to tolerate women who\ndon’t make me happy, no matter how hot they are.\nIt’s easy for me to say these things now, and what’s important is not the words.\nWhat’s important is the floodgates of emotions that came up as I discovered\nthese truths about myself. As I discovered these things about myself, it allowed\nme to express previously stifled emotions in my daily life and with women.\nBecause as I’ve discovered each one of the above truths about myself, I’ve then\nbeen able to draw boundaries based on that truth, which in turn makes me less\nneedy.\nFor instance, when I first started going out, I spent a lot of time beating my head\nagainst a wall trying to pick up the “hot” club girls at loud nightclubs. You know,\nfake tans, fake tits, fake hair, fake personalities.\nFor whatever reason, I couldn’t keep their attention long enough. Eventually,\nafter pushing things further and spending more time and effort in those places\nthan I care to admit, I went home with a few of them.\nAnd... well, it was pretty disappointing.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1944,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"CmjnGxt5JLtPk0UdYBcfRbb2hjSI9Z/Us4+hq1phrG8="},"d6fd7853-5c25-4ad5-b2c4-b26c4e6e844b":{"id_":"d6fd7853-5c25-4ad5-b2c4-b26c4e6e844b","metadata":{"page_number":63,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_63","metadata":{"page_number":63,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"5aI02aff8/HxHQmu4zWalTrLkEWGU0EFTQEVVaDYv24="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"887422dd-ee1b-49d1-b0d0-cb9c5d9be199","metadata":{},"hash":"H1W9kQm8RvVDlGsS8UsM8y+xrnMt+wn5Y1bWBMIJ8YA="}},"text":"What I discovered is that there was not anything objectively better or more\ninteresting about these girls.The only thing that seems to attract men to them is\nthe fact that they look like women they see on TV and movies and in porn.There’s nothing genuinely enticing about them other than that they are seen as a\nstatus symbol.And chasing them was borne out of neediness, not genuine\nhonesty.It took me a couple years, but I eventually realized that I was chasing a\nstatus symbol, a pat on the back, basically reliving and redeeming all of my\nfailed high school moments where the pretty girls didn’t pay attention to me.It had nothing to do with the women; it had everything to do with me.Now, when I meet a woman at a place like that who doesn’t show me any depth\nto her personality, I’m unwilling to put any more effort into getting to know her.My boundary is established: I value curiosity, education, intelligence and\nauthenticity.I also don’t value “fake” looks such as pounds of make-up, bronzer,\nhair extensions or super tight skirts.OK, maybe I do value the tight skirts.But the irony?Because that boundary is established, I’m not invested in these\nwomen much at all, and as a result, I get more attention from them than ever\nbefore.It’s important to look at the reasons why you’re over-invested around women\nand have an honest discussion with yourself about it to try and resolve it.For instance, perhaps you’re over-invested around women because you’re a\nvirgin and have no experience with them.Then you need to look at how being\ninexperienced is causing you to undervalue yourself and seek validation.You\nmust become comfortable with the idea of being inexperienced and be\ncomfortable admitting that insecurity if you wish to gain a lot of experience.Or perhaps your ex-girlfriend left you for another man and you’re bitter.Before\nyou can undo the anger that is causing you to be over-invested, you need to\ncome to terms with why you’re angry and

you.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"KibP4SSPZEq3m+2+Xqr0pISZvyfkkqIKgFDowYZwIqs="},"887422dd-ee1b-49d1-b0d0-cb9c5d9be199":{"id_":"887422dd-ee1b-49d1-b0d0-cb9c5d9be199","metadata":{"page_number":63,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_63","metadata":{"page_number":63,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"5aI02aff8/HxHQmu4zWalTrLkEWGU0EFTQEVVaDYv24="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"d6fd7853-5c25-4ad5-b2c4-b26c4e6e844b","metadata":{"page_number":63,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"KibP4SSPZEq3m+2+Xqr0pISZvyfkkqIKgFDowYZwIqs="}},"text":"For

a\nromantic or sexual relationship.\nThere are two main reasons that prevent attracted women from being with you,\nand they are both quite common: I call them friction and projection.\nFriction is

do\nanything.That said, decide whatever you like in a woman by your own standards.If you\nlike big girls or curvy girls, go for it.If you prefer black girls with dreadlocks,\nmore power to you.If you like older women or younger women, cool.Don’t\npressure yourself to live up to someone else’s standards.And again, for the love\nof god, if you don’t find her attractive, don’t pursue her.For practical purposes, we can divide up all of the women you’re attracted to\ninto three categories: Receptive, Neutral and Unreceptive.Let’s start with Unreceptive.Women who are Unreceptive are just

reasons that put women in this category are the following:\n- You’re far needier than she is, and she’s therefore not attracted to you.- She has a boyfriend/husband and is happy in her relationship.- There’s too much friction preventing her from being willing to date you,\nsuch as a difference in values, difference in interests, bad logistics, etc.\n- She’s not interested or looking for any man at the moment.The way to tell if a woman is Unreceptive is if she repeatedly does not\nreciprocate your signs of interest and/or shows you signs of disinterest.If you\ninvite her out for coffee and she keeps making excuses to why she can’t, then\nshe’s Unreceptive.If you call her three times and she never calls back, then she\nis Unreceptive.If you chat her up and she explains that she is busy and wants to\nbe alone, then she is Unreceptive.If you hang out with her and she talks about\nhow frustrated she is with her boyfriend and how you’re such a good listener,\nthen she’s Unreceptive.No exceptions.Many men waste a lot of time convincing themselves that\nUnreceptive women may actually like them.A good rule of thumb here is, “if\nyou have to ask, then that’s your answer.”That is, there should be no ambiguity\nhere.And if there is, you can quickly solve it by simply stating to her, “I think\nyou’re cute/pretty/attractive/funny/whatever, want to grab coffee/dinner/a drink\nsometime?”Problem solved.You’ll find out where you are very quickly.But I’m getting ahead of myself…The next category is Neutral.This category can be difficult for men to\nunderstand because it’s not as common for us as it is for women.Typically, a\nman knows within a few seconds if he’s willing to meet and even sleep with a\nwoman or not.Women aren’t like that.They spend a lot of time being unsure about a man and\nneed to be swayed one way or the other.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1PdqUZE/fMQa16fUZjbpbelvIu0WHN4DT5fW15uj03Y="},"ad490e45-6857-42f6-8a64-a95045a1c5c1":{"id_":"ad490e45-6857-42f6-8a64-a95045a1c5c1","metadata":{"page_number":73,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_73","metadata":{"page_number":73,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"drSmEFnQiNtyh4YV6rvDrWXvvIOBVG3vkpx9vUDOI7g="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f9f224b4-899a-464d-9c34-85f18a5bf091","metadata":{"page_number":73,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"1PdqUZE/fMQa16fUZjbpbelvIu0WHN4DT5fW15uj03Y="}},"text":"Women

invested\nbefore sex, therefore, they (usually) expect men to initiate in the beginning.There are also strong cultural pressures on women to wait for the man to initiate.The other way women demonstrate that they’re Receptive is when they\nreciprocate.It’s important to recognize the subtle difference between a woman\nreciprocating your advances and a woman being neutral toward your advances.A woman who is Neutral will simply not respond at all.For instance, if you\ntouch a Neutral woman on her back while you speak to her, she’ll just act like\nyou’re not touching her.A woman who is reciprocating will do something to respond positively to your\nadvance.Think of it as her signaling to you that she accepts your advancing on\nher and likes it.If you touched a woman on the back and she wanted to\nreciprocate, she would either lean back into you, lean in closer to you, or touch\nyou in return.Here are some other common examples of reciprocation:\n- She ignores her friends to stay and talk to you.- She keeps very strong eye contact and laughs a little too much at\neverything you say.- When you touch her, she touches you in return.- When you put your arm around her, she leans into you.- When you take her hand to move somewhere, she holds it in return.- When you ask her out on a date, she offers a place to go or mentions\nsomething she’d like to do with you.Most

ways in which women reciprocate and how to handle them.Unfortunately, the vast majority of women you will meet, assuming you’re a\ntypical guy, will be either Neutral or Unreceptive.This is true for the most of the\nmale population, myself included, so don’t worry.The percentage of women that you meet in each category will vary widely from\nman to man and also vary widely depending on the context in which you meet\nwomen.For instance, you could be a 40-year-old investing mogul, and at networking\nevents or conferences, you may find that 40% or more women are Receptive and\nfew make themselves Unreceptive or Neutral.But that same man can go to a nightclub full of drunken 20-year-olds and soon\nfind that only 1% of women are Receptive or Neutral, and 99% are Unreceptive.This is a concept I call Demographics, and I’ve devoted all of Chapter 7 to it\nbecause it’s extremely important.The exact percentages of women falling into each category aren’t really that\nrelevant.A lot of men, and even a lot of dating advice books, misplace a lot of\ntime and effort due to not understanding these three categories and the strategies\nthat go along with them.Strategies for Each Category\nYour course of action will differ depending on the type of woman you meet.Many men make the mistake of applying the wrong strategy to the wrong\ncategory of women.For instance, they’ll try to convince an Unreceptive woman\nto become Receptive.Or they’ll treat a woman who’s already Receptive as if she\nisn’t yet.Not only is this a time waster, it’s also ineffective.The goal with Unreceptive women is to identify them and move on as quickly as\npossible.They’re time sinks.Typically, if women are Unreceptive, they’re\nUnreceptive for a good reason, and it has little to do with you (or maybe it

Instead of waiting and\nhoping for a woman to select us, instead of racking up numbers, instead of\nwinning bragging rights, instead of avoiding rejections — our success is defined\nby screening through as many women as possible until we find the ones we\nenjoy and the ones who enjoy us.\nSuddenly, rejection goes from hurting our success rate to often helping it.\nHaving a great date with a woman who wants to wait to have sex with you can\nbecome a far greater success than that woman who bangs your brains out an hour","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1995,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"DBRBGxHANBHF7lvp2JLrAYY3L2j3ZQwkrb9I2goU4Yc="},"8ba5b3fc-3d4a-473d-b226-9f64f58901df":{"id_":"8ba5b3fc-3d4a-473d-b226-9f64f58901df","metadata":{"page_number":93,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_93","metadata":{"page_number":93,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"68aV53eh1nn56xfitOVuhdDesQp0RhE7JtAUdG95MZg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"dfcb0ce9-aa00-47c3-aa85-4fb895c97ac0","metadata":{},"hash":"A2eLLW+Xw/TWO9JgaqSMBQoQNGuGYIYJ5tsZDsv0d20="}},"text":"after meeting you.We screen through these women by polarizing them.We are polarizing them by\nsharing our truth with them openly and freely.And when we do this, women will\neither become incredibly attracted to us or they will reject us.Either way, we’ll\nbe the happier for it.And not only do we pursue and polarize the women we believe will make us\nhappy, but we also push the interaction.Some men become satisfied with how\nmany women they can kiss or how many phone numbers they can collect.This is\nnot success.This is not success because you are not maximizing your\nrelationships with these women.These metrics are part of the process.There is\nno happiness inherent in owning more phone numbers than anyone else.You’re\nchasing validation, not fulfillment.You are not dating them, sleeping with them,\nbecoming intimate with them or even committing to them.Get out there and\nexpose yourself.Open yourself up and find what makes you happy.Yes, that will\nmean you’ll probably get hurt.But so what?The best things in life don’t come\neasily.So it’s time to get into the nitty-gritty.So far we’ve spent most of the book being\nintrospective and talking about our emotional lives.Whether we get any specific\nwoman or not depends on our level of investment relative to our investment in\nourselves.This is non-neediness.We build non-neediness through vulnerability.We practice vulnerability by being honest.There are three ways in which we are honest.And those three ways will make up\nthe bulk of this book.The three ways are 1) living based on our values\n(lifestyle);

Improving each one of the Three\nFundamentals will improve your results, sometimes drastically. Each of the\nThree Fundamentals can be worked on independently, but as we’ll see later,\nimproving one of the three often indirectly benefits the other two and vice-versa.\nThe Three Fundamentals are:\n1. Creating an attractive and enriching lifestyle.\n2. Overcoming your fears and anxiety around socializing, intimacy and\nsexuality.\n3. Mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.\nThe way to improve each of these fundamentals is by drilling deeper into your\nvulnerability for each one of them. So one way to think about it is that the\nfundamentals are the categories in which you can improve your results with\nwomen (and general well-being), and expressing your vulnerability and seeking\ntruth is the process in which you improve in the categories.\nFor short, I refer to the Three Fundamentals as Honest Living, Honest Action,\nand Honest Communication.\nFor instance, Honest Living, or creating an attractive lifestyle involves really\ndrilling down and understanding what you want as a man for your life and then\nworking to make that a reality. If you’re in a job you hate with hobbies you hate\nand friends you don’t like, then no matter what you do or how much money you\nmake, you’re going to have a hard time meeting attractive women that you enjoy\nand who enjoy being with you. This is because the identity you have adopted\ndoes not accurately reflect your emotional needs and desires. You are not living\nyour life honestly, which means you are not investing in yourself, which means\nyou are needy and unattractive.\nIf your true passion is art and you push paper around at an insurance firm, then\nyou’re not living honestly.

your fear and anxiety will correlate with your overall results with\nwomen.The reason being that once a man overcomes his fear of rejection, he’s\nwilling to more or less pursue any woman he wants when he wants.Even if he’s\na deadbeat (lacks a good lifestyle) or even if he’s terrible at expressing himself\n(lacks good communication skills), he will eventually meet women who want to\ndate him and sleep with him by no other means than pure numbers.If he’s\nwilling to approach 500 women with no fear of rejection, eventually at least one\nof them is going to stick.Honest Action correlates directly to the quantity of women you meet and attract.The third fundamental is Honest Communication, or learning to express yourself\nfreely and effectively.This is what most dating advice sells and classifies as\n“game” — a good sense of humor, the ability to connect with people, telling\nstories, engaging people’s attention, having charisma, and expressing your\nsexuality openly.These are all parts of this fundamental.I call it Honest Communication because it’s learning how to communicate your\ntrue intentions and emotions to others clearly.Often we have certain thoughts or\nfeelings, but we don’t know the best way to convey those thoughts or feelings.This third fundamental focuses on how to do that.Honest Communication will determine the efficiency with which you are able to\nattract women who are compatible to you.A man who communicates poorly or\nis unable to express himself clearly will lose a lot of romantic opportunities to\n“lost in translation” situations — misunderstandings, vague communications,\ninaccurate assumptions, etc.\nNatural Advantages/Disadvantages\nChances are, you’re already pretty strong in one or more of the Three\nFundamentals and weak or mediocre at one or more of them.Where your\nstrengths and weaknesses lie will determine not just the quantity of your results\nwith women, but also the types of outcomes you achieve.For instance, a

them.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"Z7yTOVyRcyn6A+AzpUoYA+Wu/S+Wx/eDExFDB3sU/90="},"d673dc3f-30be-43a6-b4b3-d338c3176daf":{"id_":"d673dc3f-30be-43a6-b4b3-d338c3176daf","metadata":{"page_number":97,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_97","metadata":{"page_number":97,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"auCGq9b3rBjz2pFA6tsnN4ZCsGiTx33Wh8suYAj2TKw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"faf1b019-3b7f-4ff6-8430-7bb2127c1dfc","metadata":{"page_number":97,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Z7yTOVyRcyn6A+AzpUoYA+Wu/S+Wx/eDExFDB3sU/90="}},"text":"Classic

to breaking down each of the\nFundamentals individually and giving clear how-to guides for improving them.Identifying and focusing on the fundamental(s) you need to work on most will\nbe the quickest route to improving your love life and sex life.Most of you will\nhave one or two main weaknesses and probably one natural strength.But some\nof you may be weak in all of them.I guarantee you, if you’re reading this, you\nare not strong in all of them.If you think you are and are still reading this far,\nthen you’re deluding yourself and need to re-read Chapter 3 on being honest\nwith yourself.Two Types of Men\nIn my experience, almost all men who struggle with relationships fall into one of\ntwo categories: socially anxious or socially disconnected.Socially anxious men tend to have the third fundamental down very well.They’re good at expressing themselves and are very aware of social norms and\nwhat others are thinking/feeling.In fact, in a lot of cases, socially anxious men\nare too aware of what other people are thinking and feeling and, therefore, have\na lot of social anxiety.They’re afraid to speak to new women.They get nervous\npushing things forward.They’re scared to ask women on dates.Generally, though, once these men do meet a woman who likes them, they do\nOK.They can converse with her all night.And if she happens to be attracted to\nhim, he’s not such a mess.But it’s the actual being pro-active and making a\nmove that scares him to death.These men usually spend most of their time\nfocusing on overcoming fear and little time on expression.Socially disconnected men are the opposite.These are men who have always\nbeen a little bit “oblivious” to what others think and feel around them.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"mhSyk0GEvuNuWihx5S/bCslHWv+9lZcNPrnRmsWh5/E="},"ba63089c-9d52-4c93-8ac4-0ad784894645":{"id_":"ba63089c-9d52-4c93-8ac4-0ad784894645","metadata":{"page_number":99,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_99","metadata":{"page_number":99,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Ol9LCPBUxikLDKJgOsaiqHvt+4DUYmHvJV8gWez8y7o="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"70f2db84-a7ae-4325-9f9b-a27881e1d3ed","metadata":{"page_number":99,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"mhSyk0GEvuNuWihx5S/bCslHWv+9lZcNPrnRmsWh5/E="}},"text":"Usually,\nthey’re

tell men, “The only thing all of the women you date have in\ncommon is you.”What I mean by that is if all of the women you date end up\nlying and being manipulative, or if all of the women you date are selfish and\ntreat you poorly, or if all of the women you date are meek and have no\npersonality, then likely there is something in your beliefs and behavior that is\nnaturally screening for those

and\nrelationships is far harder and more uncomfortable than simply memorizing a\npick up line or two.That’s why most men don’t ever bother doing it.And that’s\nwhy these men never experience long-term success.I think acknowledging your beliefs and also being able to acknowledge that they\nmay not be true comes back to what was discussed in Chapter 3: being able to\ntake an open and honest look at yourself and your desires.Becoming a non-\nneedy man requires, first and foremost, a high level of honesty with yourself.Part of that honesty with yourself involves observing and challenging

Money, and Looks\nThe touchiest part of demographics — and possibly the touchiest subject of all\ndating advice — is that of age, money, and looks.I want to get this out of the way and make it 100% clear.Age, money, and looks\nmatter — in some cases a lot, in other cases, not a lot, but they still matter.And\nanyone who tells you that they don’t matter is lying.With that said, age, money, and looks don’t matter nearly as much as most men\nthink.And if you’re aware of the effects of demographics, you can work around\nthem and even work them to your advantage.When it comes to age, studies show that men’s physical attractiveness peaks at\naround 31 (a luxury considering women peak around 21) and that our physical\nattractiveness recedes far slower than it does for women.In fact, studies have\nfound that the average 45-year-old male is still considered as physically\nattractive as the average 18-year-old male.The main reason is that studies have also found that women judge a man’s status\nfar less on actual physical dimensions and far more on style, grooming, and how\nmen present themselves.As men, we’re extremely lucky in this regard.Taking a\nman from a baggy beer T-shirt and ill-fitted jeans to a nice suit with a\nprofessional haircut will immediately bump him up 50% in the looks department\novernight, whereas with women, it’s a constant and never-ending battle to\nmaximize their physical appearance as much as possible.How to be as good-looking as possible will be covered in depth in the following\nchapter, but for now, just know that no matter how ugly you think you are (and\nchances are, you aren’t), there’s hope for you.And we’ll take care of it soon\nenough.Money is nice in that it demonstrates success and implies other positive\nattractive traits.But again, its utility is vastly overblown.When it comes to\nmoney, once again the surveys and studies have some interesting findings.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kdHTeOTrqvkKzTZIyDf3iVnUNsc6ClnA39NTE72HlYo="},"53db2bfc-2dbd-4c87-b568-5eb3fcee9cfb":{"id_":"53db2bfc-2dbd-4c87-b568-5eb3fcee9cfb","metadata":{"page_number":113,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_113","metadata":{"page_number":113,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"4U0lMzTh6I3M8jTLk1mqHlBoFJvpQ7VrEm7iDT8lqqs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3b4a7ff2-df77-4673-9ece-ca7370a077ad","metadata":{"page_number":113,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"kdHTeOTrqvkKzTZIyDf3iVnUNsc6ClnA39NTE72HlYo="}},"text":"When

is why the stereotypical gold-digger is usually a very beautiful young\nwoman who grew up in poverty. Women who grow up with money or have\nmoney usually don’t care about it as much.\nBut the fact remains that women perceive men with money the same way we\nperceive women with good looks: as social status. How each woman defines\nsocial status and whether money is a part of that or not is going to vary from\nwoman to woman.\nWhich brings me to my primary point when it comes to age, money, and looks.\nAgain, it’s about the demographics.\nI saw a quote recently that said, “Only lazy women are interested in men with\nmoney, because they don’t have anything else going for them.”\nAsk yourself for which demographic of women are looks and money highly\nimportant? Women who tend to only value good looks tend to be women who\nonly have good looks and little else to offer. Women who are highly interested in\nmoney are going to be women who don’t have other interests or opportunities in\nfront of them.\nWhat I’m saying is, women who only care about things such as looks and money\nare usually going to be women who you’re not going to be interested in or who\nare not going to make you happy. So you’re not missing out on much.\nWith that said, everybody values looks and success to a certain extent. So it’s not\nsomething we can write off completely. You should be as good-looking as you\ncan possibly be. And you should be as financially successful as you can possibly\nbe. And even the most interesting and well-rounded and psychologically healthy\nwomen are still going to prefer a good-looking and successful man to one who\nisn’t. All things equal, looks and money always increase your odds.\nBut I would just add the caveat that you should be as good-looking as possible\nfor you. You should be as financially successful as possible for you. These are\njust other avenues in which to invest in yourself.\nSo yes, looks and money matter.

Proof\nThe concept of social proof comes from influence psychology and is well\ndocumented in everything from salesmanship to advertising, to politics, and to\nattraction and relationships.The idea is that as humans when we see many other people valuing something,\nwe will unconsciously value it ourselves.For instance, if everybody else is\ntalking about a new movie, we are more likely to want to see it because we’ll\nunconsciously assume that it’s a good or important movie to see.This works with people as well.If you’re at a party and someone walks in and\neverybody in the party stops what they’re doing to turn and say hello to that\nperson, your first thought would probably be, “Wow, who is that guy?”Chances\nare you’d want to meet him as well.The idea is that this applies to women and attraction as well.If you are that man\nwho walks into a room and everybody stops what they are doing to talk to you,\nthen the women in the room are more likely to perceive you as high status and be\nattracted to you.Or if you’re a man with whom multiple women are flirting, then\nit’s going to incite even more women to begin flirting with you.This is one reason why men in power — celebrities, athletes, etc. — are desired\nby so many women.The goal, as a man, is to cultivate as much social proof\nwithin your demographic as possible.So, for instance, if you are a high-powered executive at your firm, then you have\na large degree of social status and social proof at work.Chances are, the women\nwho work with you are going to have some degree of attraction for you.But if\nyou go to a bar on the weekend and know nobody there, then your social status\nis back to nothing.You’re just another man there.Social proof only functions within a demographic itself.That’s why once you’ve\nnarrowed down your demographic, you want to cultivate your connections and\nput yourself into as big of a leadership position as possible.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JT+AMOfg8FsAzgaLIvUEJm941JbFekuE4bLEJhIZGhI="},"f0abfbea-2c5d-4866-80bf-884e4a9576b5":{"id_":"f0abfbea-2c5d-4866-80bf-884e4a9576b5","metadata":{"page_number":116,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_116","metadata":{"page_number":116,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"QkaVzRtIXkb0YjTqJRoFqza7QbZSheKLDepp/TjR9Nk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"13633fa6-5e5f-4c56-81a6-772afaed47c8","metadata":{"page_number":116,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"JT+AMOfg8FsAzgaLIvUEJm941JbFekuE4bLEJhIZGhI="}},"text":"Don’t

it’s that it is far more powerful to be\nsomething attractive rather than to say something attractive.You can say the\nmost attractive sentence in the world, but if it isn’t backed up by who you are,\nthen it’s not going to have any meaning.Whereas if you are something amazing,\nthen anything you say will be attractive because it will be coming from a\ngenuinely attractive man.Women are attracted to your identity.Words mean nothing.What you say is only\na means to buy you enough time to show her that identity.Notice I said “show\nher” not “tell her.”For instance, imagine you meet two different men.One of them is a scrubby,\nugly, and shady character.He can’t look you in the eye.He smells bad.He\nmumbles to himself and scratches himself in inappropriate places.While you’re\ntalking to him, he looks at you and says, “You know, I get a good feeling from\nyou, you’re someone worth knowing.”How would that make you feel?You’d probably get the creeps and want to get away from him as

Science and psychology show that this isn’t the case.\nMen judge female beauty by physical traits first, personality and presentation\nsecond: high cheekbones, facial symmetry, waist-to-hip ratio, breast size, etc. As\nsuch, we often fall into the mistake that women judge our attractiveness with the\nsame metrics; hence, obsessions with bench presses, height, and penis pills.\nYes, physical measurements play a role in how a man’s appearance is judged, but\nresearch shows that other factors are more important.\nThat’s why I draw the distinction between being good-looking and being\nattractive. Not everybody is born good-looking. But any man, with some time\nand effort, can become attractive. And in the end, what women want is a man\nwho is attractive.\nFor some reason, many men believe that their physical appearance is set in stone\nand they rarely have any interest in altering it or making any major changes.\nWhat they don’t understand is that the same man can present himself in varying\nways, some of which are far more attractive than others.\nHere are a couple unfortunate truths. The first is that appearance is extremely\nimportant. The difference between being perceived as stylish and unstylish is\nnight and day. Yes, you can still be dressed like a bum and get girls, but the\ndifference in the effort-to-reward ratio is massive. A makeover and wardrobe\nchange can make meeting and dating women three times easier literally\novernight. Not to mention all of the psychological side benefits of making you\nfeel more confident, more interesting, more excited, etc.\nRemember, your outward appearance is a reflection of your self-investment (or\nlack thereof). And your level of self-investment will make you less needy\ntowards others, therefore making your behavior more attractive. If you don’t put\na lot of time and effort into how you look and how you present yourself to the\nworld, women look at that and make unconscious assumptions about your

the first step is recognizing what you don’t know.\nThere are a few rules to dressing well:\n1. Wear clothes that fit.\n2. Wear clothes that match.\n3. Dress to your personality\nWe’ll go through and break each one down, one by one:\nClothes that fit: To start, the vast majority of men don’t wear clothes that fit them\nproperly. Men often prefer comfort and practicality to any aesthetic purpose of\nwearing clothing, so most of their clothing is too big. Chances are most of your\nclothing right now is too big. Many men are also self-conscious about their body,\nso they buy large clothing to mask it.\nWhen it comes to clothing, fit is king. You can have the nicest, most expensive\nclothes in the world, but if they don’t fit well you’ll look like a clown. On the\nother hand, you can have some modest or even mediocre clothing, but if it fits\nwell (and you’re in decent shape), you’ll look quite good.\nFit makes a massive difference and the change is immediately apparent:\nThe first step to overhauling your wardrobe should be to go through your closet\nand pull out anything and everything that does not fit well.\nYou should always know your measurements. If you’re not quite sure, ask to get\nmeasured. Most clothing department stores have a tailor who will gladly take\nyour measurements for you.\nWith shirts, the shoulder seam should extend to the end of the shoulder, not any\nfurther. If it extends past the end of your shoulder, then the shirt is too big.\nOn dress shirts, the cuffs should not extend past the wrist bone.\nThe bottom of your pants or jeans should rest gently on the top of your shoes\n(unless you have a specific style of rocker or hip hop jeans). There should not be\nmore than one “break” in your jeans — a break is a natural fold from them\nresting on the top of your shoe.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1789,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"kBPpuQbo4iMkl0xa53nPB2WSUqrS3Aqt/V12ol7dRrk="},"6ab90b9b-7657-4e46-a9e7-810255096cad":{"id_":"6ab90b9b-7657-4e46-a9e7-810255096cad","metadata":{"page_number":123,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_123","metadata":{"page_number":123,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"6NTzPfqWj0tyjZQEq37a/m6AuWiZm98/kwa75nov4TM="}},"text":"If you’re stepping on the back of your pants with the heel of your shoe, they’re\ntoo long.

Beyond simply making\nyou look better naked, exercise boosts your energy, raises testosterone,\nrelieves symptoms of depression and anxiety, and generally makes you feel\nbetter about yourself.\nThe exact way that you exercise isn’t as important as the fact that you do it.\nIf you like to play soccer, then find people to play soccer with.

An easy starting point that will give you 80% of the\nresults for 20% of the effort is simply cutting out the following things:\nsodas, fast food, desserts, and candy. If you just cut those things out of your\ndiet, you’ll see a drastic improvement.\nThere’s a lot of info out there on low-carb, high-carb, high-protein, low-fat,\nand so on and so on. Nutrition information is a sea that you can easily\ndrown yourself in.\nBut if you start with the most fundamental basics and cut the above things\nout of your diet (and start exercising regularly), it’s impossible to not see\nmajor benefits within a few months.\nAnd again, similar to exercise, nutrition goes beyond making you look sexy.\nIt makes you feel better, gives you higher energy, makes

studies claim that body language accounts for as much of 60% of all\ncommunication that occurs between two people.That’s a lot.Considering all of the discussion we’ve had about neediness, intention, and sub-\ncommunication in the beginning of the book, the importance of body language\nshouldn’t surprise you.Major body language problems can be addressed consciously and with practice.But your body language will continue to improve as a side effect of becoming\nless needy and getting plenty of exercise.To analyze your posture in this section, you will need the help of a mirror\n(preferably full-body).1.Start by facing the mirror and then turn 90 degrees to the right or left.You should have a perfect “side view” of yourself.Now look at the “ridge”\nthat extends from your neck to the end of your shoulder.If you’re wearing a\nshirt, look at the seam that extends from your neck to your sleeve.That\nseam or ridge on almost everyone will be slanted forward.Move your\nshoulders back until that ridge or seam is straight — going straight from\nyour neck to your shoulder.That’s the optimal position for your shoulders.Remember that position and remind yourself to hold your shoulders there as\noften as possible.2.Next, turn and look directly into the mirror, with your shoulders back,\nraise your chin up until it’s at a 90-degree angle with your neck.Your eyes\nshould be looking dead-ahead now, straight into themselves in the mirror, or\naiming straight at the horizon as if you were walking.Make the back of\nyour neck as straight as possible with your back.Notice when you pull your\nhead up like this with your shoulders back, your stomach naturally comes\nin, and your back naturally straightens up.This is what we want!3.Next, look at your feet.They should be shoulder-width apart.Take note\nof which way your feet are pointing.They should be pointed straight ahead\nor slightly outward at the most.If they’re pointed inward or very far\noutward, this will cause posture problems and make you walk funny.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"t8bHbyz4Deh8UGMXlUFpyTIJDOguiZMOwcqckXSjO28="},"4014997d-c6be-4937-aac0-fe566f49bda5":{"id_":"4014997d-c6be-4937-aac0-fe566f49bda5","metadata":{"page_number":129,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_129","metadata":{"page_number":129,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"6fPR6ED1y03RLXF6+619ekBQXPaVdoIMNlnhMgvxqnU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dfc614b3-64ca-4a12-8c07-89a62bc6144d","metadata":{"page_number":129,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"t8bHbyz4Deh8UGMXlUFpyTIJDOguiZMOwcqckXSjO28="}},"text":"Turn\nthem

9:\nWhat Are Your Stories?I park my car in front of the gym and immediately pop my headphones into my\nears.As I get out and walk across the parking lot, I catch a glimpse of a slender\nfigure walking

it was for me.The first step to overcoming your fears is to figure out what your pattern is.When we are confronted with our fears or anxieties, we have a pattern or\nstrategy that we usually use to deal with them.For instance, my most common\npattern is apathy.Whenever I’m confronted with something I’m afraid of, I\npretend — or scratch that, I convince myself — that I don’t actually care.Here\nare some of the most common patterns that I’ve noticed:\n1.Blame Game — The Blame Game is where, when confronted with\nsomething he’s afraid of, a man blames someone or something else for his\nfear.For instance, let’s say you’re anxious about giving a presentation at work.Someone who does the Blame Game will come up with reasons why his\nboss is stupid and how he’s way too smart to be doing this anyway and how\nit’s not his fault if things go wrong because he’s been sick and so-and-so\ndidn’t do enough research.In the context of women, the Blame Game will often result in men\nconvincing themselves of stuff like, “Oh, she’s stuck up,” or “She’s just into\nguys who are good-looking,” or “She’s too stupid for me anyway,” or “This\nclub is too loud to talk to people,” or “Women in Miami are just bitches, I\nneed to find a new city.”The excuses and blame can be petty and ridiculous, but they can also run\ndeep.The awful part of the blame game is that with it come anger and\nfrustration.And if you do it enough, the anger will pile up and you will end\nup with some pretty bitter and irrational beliefs about women.Men who\nhave played the blame game their whole lives may develop screwed up\nbeliefs like, “All women care about is how much money a guy has,” or “All\ngirls in bars are stupid and shallow.”This can lead to some pretty dark\nplaces.2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HQyg98SrGHvfy9bjW7E0s/5OxNpY+OAcDDyt5kRB5Vk="},"56606c4d-5d0b-4962-8686-9bf774046458":{"id_":"56606c4d-5d0b-4962-8686-9bf774046458","metadata":{"page_number":145,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_145","metadata":{"page_number":145,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"yvSIf/eG9sZz2fMSl5txQimzcCm+p5bkgjNmPEXcg38="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"974a3354-980f-4269-9ca4-3165b3973771","metadata":{"page_number":145,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"HQyg98SrGHvfy9bjW7E0s/5OxNpY+OAcDDyt5kRB5Vk="}},"text":"This

over.Where it is dangerous is in other areas of\nour life such as career, family or hobbies.The apathy and avoidance pattern\nis the root behind the couch potatoes and disgruntled office workers of the\nworld.3.Intellectualizing — I guarantee that this is part of the reason you’re here:\nyou have some sort of fear, anxiety or pain related to women, and instead of\nactually doing something about it, you got online and decided to look up an\nanswer that you could study.Intellectualizing is sometimes beneficial in that you can learn a ton of\ninformation about a lot of subjects, and sometimes, the intellectualizing will\nlead to more self-awareness and help clarify what sort of action you need to\ntake.But there are many men who use intellectualizing as just another form\nof avoidance.It tends to be really smart guys too, which is a problem,\nbecause the smarter you are, the more you’re able to intellectualize and\nconvince yourself that you need to learn and understand more.But when it comes to women, this is not the answer (says the guy who\nwrote a 200-page book on women).Honestly, if you went out and talked to\nwomen for a year without ever reading a word of dating advice, you’d\nprobably do OK, assuming you were honest with yourself and able to learn\nfrom your mistakes.Sure, this stuff all helps, but in the end, your best\nteacher is your experience.There comes a certain point where learning\nmore about a subject is no longer beneficial and on the contrary, is just\ngoing to get you more mixed up and confused, since you have no\nexperience to actually apply your knowledge to.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gIdZucE45uTnFEQIsCMDEnM1GAH9QiiH9NIjK9J+cTI="},"fd98ae02-9757-4119-917d-629e88728b33":{"id_":"fd98ae02-9757-4119-917d-629e88728b33","metadata":{"page_number":146,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_146","metadata":{"page_number":146,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"lU+aRAoP0smbXyrA6LibP/ve9+hY0FaUcIwqn0OKVpc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5dffa1d1-8193-4cc2-ab6b-a7acf5449922","metadata":{"page_number":146,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"gIdZucE45uTnFEQIsCMDEnM1GAH9QiiH9NIjK9J+cTI="}},"text":"Intellectualizing

a bit of an epidemic of sexual apathy going on worldwide, where\nhusbands, boyfriends and even single men are turning to pornography rather than\nthe real life women that they see walking around every day.And it makes sense\nwhy: it’s easier, the women are hot, the sex is more exciting, it’s available at any\ntime with the click of a mouse, it’s (usually) free, the girls never say no, it’s\nemotionless and there are no obligations or commitments involved.The problem is that there are some negative side effects.The first being that porn\ncreates very, very unrealistic expectations about sex, about women, and about\nsexuality.Porn makes money by accentuating and exaggerating sexual ideals.Actual sex with an actual woman often involves awkward moments of figuring\nout what she likes, what you like, who likes it which way.It also often involves\necstatic moments of emotional intimacy, something porn can never provide.Also, real women, no matter how hot they are, have imperfections —\nimperfections that are covered up in porn by makeup and plastic surgery.If a guy\ngets too accustomed to the perfectionism of porn, he’s going to have a lot more\ntrouble becoming motivated by the girls he sees every day.The other problem is that porn is so easy, that it encourages men to masturbate a\nlot.And as we all know, as men, the more we masturbate, the more interested we\nbecome in food and television, and the less we become in women and\naccomplishing something.Napoleon Hill wrote a famous section in his classic work Think and Grow Rich\ncalled “Sexual Transfiguration.”Hill noticed and theorized that extremely\nsuccessful men also had extremely high sex drives.And not only did they have\nvery high sex drives, but they also channeled this sexual energy into their work\nand their accomplishments.Often they would abstain from sex or masturbation\nfor long periods of time and would, therefore, feel more energized.Science is starting to back this

sometimes men use reading and hoarding information and advice as a\nway to avoid taking action.They feel like if they’re reading a 150-page book on\nattraction, then they’re accomplishing something right?And as long as they’re\naccomplishing something, then they don’t have to confront what they’re afraid\nof: going out and standing in front of a woman and expressing their truth, being\nvulnerable, subjecting themselves to rejection.This isn’t a new problem.The self-help and business advice industries have been\ndealing with it for decades.The men’s dating advice industry has been dealing\nwith it as well.But up until this point, it’s done a piss-poor job of motivating\nmen and helping to teach them how to take action.The classic advice when it comes to taking action is more or less to jump into the\ndeep end until you learn to swim.The idea was that if you had a crippling fear of approaching women, then you\nsign up for a “boot camp” or program where a coach takes you out to a bar and\nmore or less yells at you until you approach 25 women in one night.What you\nsay and what happens is all over the place, but at least you’re getting off your ass\nand doing something.The problem with the overload method of taking action is that it’s short-term and\ndoesn’t create a lasting habit.There’s a simpler and less stressful method for\nachieving long-term results over your anxieties.The Guide to Overcoming Your Anxiety\nFear is normal.Everyone has it in some form, and it's not going away

you want to get rid of all of your fear is like saying you want to get rid of\nall anger, or all sadness.This sounds like a noble goal, but research shows we\ninstead suppress or avoid the emotions, leaving us less capable of dealing with\nthem the next time they arise.Instead, what I recommend is to learn to adapt our\nnegative emotions into positive behavior.For instance, people with anger issues are encouraged to channel their anger\nthrough productive means — exercising, working, writing letters displaying their\nfeelings, etc. To avoid or ignore the anger will only bring it back worse next\ntime.When my first girlfriend broke up with me, I made a conscious decision.I had\nlaid in bed depressed for a week or two before I realized how ridiculous and\npointless it was.I was hurt and I was angry, but laying around in bed and\navoiding her was stressing me out.If I’m going to be stressed out, I may as well\nbe productive.So I decided to try another strategy.I decided that I would work on myself.I told\nmyself I was doing it so that she would be sorry she ever broke up with me.I did\nit out of spite.My inspiration for self-improvement began with revenge.For the first time in my life, I joined a gym.I began studying more.I went out\nwith a female friend and bought some new clothes.I went to parties with new\npeople I met.The whole time my motivation was the anger and

problem with interpreting the anxiety around women as something\nthat must be removed is that this often only serves to amplify it.Neurobiology\nhas shown us that attempting to avoid or shut out

only quantify one aspect of your interactions at a time.So if you want to be less nervous approaching women, don’t bother yourself\nworrying about how to get phone numbers or when to go for the kiss

form of avoidance\nfor men who are terrified of “later stage” parts of dating women — escalating,\ndates, sex, etc. — is that they’ll actually use approaching more women as a form\nof avoidance.They’ll have a beautiful woman totally enrapt with them, and\ninstead of seeing how far they can push things, they’ll take her number and\nmove on, because they tell themselves they want to keep “working on\napproaches.”When approaching is not their problem.Getting sexual with\nwomen is!Again, some self-awareness is critical.Take things one at a time, stair-step them\nslowly until you get not only comfortable with it, but excited about it, and then\nmove on to the next thing.That excitement and enthusiasm will bleed over into\nthe next form of anxiety and motivate you to keep

fear and acting despite it builds courage.Anytime you’re afraid to do\nsomething and feel some invisible force holding you back, yet you push through\nit anyway, you’re building courage within yourself.Courage is a habit.Courage is a form of discipline.It’s taking a certain action\neven though you feel like doing something else.The difference here is that\ncourage involves acting against fear, whereas discipline involves acting against\nlaziness or fatigue.Courage is built like a muscle.The stair-stepped exercises in the previous section\nare designed to progressively build your courage.The more courage you build,\nthe more you’ll be capable of bold actions.Bold actions require a lot of\nvulnerability and build non-neediness.Stopping a woman and asking her for the time requires little courage and is not a\nbold action.It’s well within social norms.Walking up to a group of six people sitting down, asking to speak to the most\nattractive woman for a moment, telling her that you find her beautiful and you’d\nlike to take her out sometime, is quite bold.It’s bold because it requires a lot of\ncourage to disrupt social norms and it requires quite a bit of vulnerability.But there’s a caveat here.You must know that you’re interrupting social norms.You must acknowledge that what you are doing is unusual.If you don’t, you’ll\nbe seen as someone who is out of touch and oblivious, which is not attractive.This is a common mistake that many of the Social Disconnect types of men\nmake.Since they’re so out of tune with social norms, they often have no\nproblem behaving in a bold way.The problem is, they aren’t aware of when\nthey’re being bold or not.For instance, I once worked with a guy who was very socially disconnected.We\nwere in a shopping mall and we were walking around talking to women together.As we were going down an escalator, we saw a very attractive girl going up the\nup escalator on the other side.As we passed her I mentioned to

We discuss sports\nstatistics, how we fixed our car last weekend, and where we plan on going next\nmonth. If a man says, “I’ll see you at 6 PM,” he typically means it literally. If a\nman tells you that he used to be the best basketball player at his college, you take\nit at face value, even if he may be exaggerating a little bit. If a man says he\ndislikes you, then it means he’s not your friend anymore and you move on.\nWomen communicate more in feelings and, more specifically, through\nintentions. Sure, they still pay attention to the facts and stories on the surface,\nbut what’s actually communicated to them is the intention and feeling\nunderneath.\nThis is sub-communication.\nThis is why your girlfriend can get upset and tell you she hates it when you\nspend time with your friends one night, and then the next night she insists you go\nto your weekly bowling league and not see any contradiction in her statements.\nOn the first night, she felt like you weren’t paying enough attention to her. On\nthe second, she felt secure with you and wants you to be happy. The issue wasn’t\nactually your friends, it was simply her feeling valued.\nNeedless to say, this sort of stuff often confuses the hell out of men, often for an\nentire lifetime.\nThis is why men often refer women to “crazy,” “irrational” or “unstable.”\nThe fact that men are oblivious to the emotions and intentions that underline\neverything women say often makes women feel like men are

could pee in their butt.Obviously, his words were absolutely ridiculous,\nand all of the women he approached — both the ones who rejected him and the\none he went home with — didn’t give his words much credit.But his intention was loud and clear: I don’t care what you think, I want to have\nfun tonight, and my idea of fun is a little extreme because I’m extreme.Obviously, this scared a few women off.But once he found one who liked his\nintentions, she latched on quickly and hard.That’s an extreme example, but here’s another, much more common example.Some dating advice tells men not to compliment a woman too early or too often.The reason for this is that most men who read dating advice have poor\nintentions: they’re needy and looking to validate themselves through sex or\nfemale affection.So when a man compliments a woman out of neediness, it’s\ngoing to make a woman feel uncomfortable and objectified.Now if a man compliments a woman out of genuine appreciation for her, she’s\ngoing to hear his intention and be genuinely appreciative of him as well.Teasing and flirting with women is another great example.Many men, when\nthey first begin trying to flirt with women, will tease them or “neg” them.Ask\nyourself this, what’s the difference between a tease and an insult?Both are\nderogatory statements.Both often incorporate humor.So what’s the difference?Intention.Teasing is done with a fun and positive intention.Insults are done with\na negative intention.Or what’s the difference between sharing yourself and bragging?Let’s say you\nare

A man who is non-needy\nwill have intentions dominated by vulnerability and will therefore be attractive\nregardless of what he says.\nObviously, there are technical considerations in how you communicate to\npeople, which we’ll cover throughout this chapter and the next.

It’s\nsimply unavoidable. No matter how cool, rich, good-looking and charming you\nare, at some point, somewhere a woman is going to be creeped out by you.

your actions and words.And the more distrustful she is, the more insecure\nshe will feel and the creepier you become.For instance, if you approach a\nwoman and stand there and talk about the weather,

or roleplaying) follow the same basic formula: they all involve\nbreaking rapport in order to generate sexual tension.Scientific research shows that sexual tension builds when the uncertainty of\npotential sexual possibilities is presented in an interaction.For example, if I say something with implied sexual innuendo like, “Well, that’s\ncool you are into cats, maybe I can come over and play with your pussy for a\nwhile,” this generates sexual tension because, assuming she doesn’t throw her\ndrink in my face or slap me, it leaves the possibility of a future sexual encounter\non the table.It’s a story with no ending, the human brain wants to know what\nhappens next.And in this case, what happens next is probably something sexual.Teasing type behaviors generate sexual tension because they generate\nuncertainty as to whether or not you’re actually interested in a woman.In the\nexample above, depending on the context and situation, I could be totally joking\nand being facetious.Or I could be totally serious and masking my desires behind\na thinly-veiled joke.She doesn’t know.And that’s what makes it so good.The\nuncertainty generates the tension.If you tease a woman about her hair, telling her she looks like ET with a perm, or\nthat your grandmother once owned a wig like that, you accomplish sexual\ntension because you are sending mixed signals.Your intentions are sending a\n“Yes, I like you,” signal, while your words are sending a, “No, I don’t,” signal.This generates uncertainty and, therefore, sexual tension.This is why most dating advice in western culture, to both men and women,\nencourages you to send mixed messages, “play hard to get,” or play games with\none another.Sure, it distorts intentions, but it also generates uncertainty and\ntherefore, sexual tension.But one can flirt by being clear with one’s intentions as well.One can state one’s\nsexual desires clearly or actually even move to make those sexual

and boring.But eventually, exposing yourself and\nyour sexual desires will force you to be less invested, more confident, more\ndominant, and more attractive.The teasing will help by creating the perception\nof non-neediness, and the boldness will make women more and more receptive\nto your eventual sexual advances.But unlike fears of living an attractive lifestyle, flirting and expressing your\nsexuality requires communicating effectively.It requires competency at certain\nsocial behaviors.And social behaviors, like any other kind of behavior, aren’t\nsimply picked up overnight.They must be built and honed through practice.Developing an Emotional Connection\nYour ability to connect with a woman emotionally is proportional to how self-\naware you are of your own emotional processes and motivations.As described in Chapter 2, self-awareness and vulnerability will cause you to\nbehave in a less needy manner, they give her the chance to know the “real you,”\nto trust you, and to open her own emotions up to you.Ultimately, this is what most women want.If you look at romance novels —\nbasically the female version of porn — they all follow more or less the exact\nsame pattern: hard and rugged bad-boy type male hero is troubled but strong,\nand as he slowly opens up and shares his true emotions and desires with the\nheroine, she’s able to support him, to save him and ultimately fall in love with\nhim.Of course, they live happily ever after.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"2rSV1qzn040Qu0uNkNZbePCxHiNv+P6n0uBjehXgfmE="},"5bdc6a3c-cfcc-4eb6-a64d-f8d303083be0":{"id_":"5bdc6a3c-cfcc-4eb6-a64d-f8d303083be0","metadata":{"page_number":176,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_176","metadata":{"page_number":176,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"tQwt1dBpnzzdzDpZGdSeBwV8UjFvCQfhXpwyEOC1qw8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"dd9f0ab1-a5ba-4f9c-b32f-2e02a7ae10ee","metadata":{"page_number":176,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"2rSV1qzn040Qu0uNkNZbePCxHiNv+P6n0uBjehXgfmE="}},"text":"Of

her.If she doesn't trust you or isn't 100% convinced that\nyou really like her and care about her, then she's not going to do it.And if she\ndoes, then she’ll regret it and feel dirty.So how do you

opinion of others when making an observation.The specific habits that are attractive and unattractive will be covered in the next\nchapter.But for now, I want to wrap up this chapter by going over the process by\nwhich you can build and break these habits.A lot of men get the wrong idea.They’ll read some dating advice saying\nsomething like, “touch her on the arm when you smile at her.”Then they’ll go\nout and do it and it’ll feel very awkward and stilted, so they’ll never do it again.The reason it feels awkward and stilted is because they’ve never done it before.It’s not a habit for them yet.In fact, not touching a woman when they smile is a\nhabit, and they’re trying to break it.Habits are hard to break.They take time.And you have to do them repeatedly.The trick is to identify the good/bad habits you want to build or break and the\nfocus on them consciously until they’re second nature.This actually doesn’t take\na long time.For simple things such as eye contact or posture, it may only take a\nfew weeks.For things such as touching, or making statements instead of\nquestions, it may be even shorter.Either way, the more you implement the habits, the better your reactions from\nwomen will be, thereby increasing your motivation to implement the habits\nfurther.Basically, what I’m saying here, is that everything described in the next chapter\nis not an overnight fix, you have to go out and do it over and over again.And just as with desensitizing yourself to your anxieties, you want to focus on\none at a time, two at the

Communication\nis always up for interpretation; therefore, there’s always going to be a chance\nthat you’ll be misunderstood or people might make incorrect judgments about\nyou. There’s also a good chance that you aren’t expressing yourself clearly or\neffectively.\nFor instance, you may ask a girl out for coffee. But perhaps she’s inexperienced\nor comes from a conservative background, and so what is a clear statement of\ninterest from you, appears to her as just an invitation for friendship.\nOr maybe you compliment a woman on her dress. But for whatever reason, your\ntonality, and facial expression aren’t clear and she thinks you’re being sarcastic.\nMaybe she’s insecure and very touchy about men complimenting her, so she\nresponds negatively.\nIn the long run, misunderstandings and miscommunications are unavoidable. No\nmatter how clear and how charming you are there are always going to be women\nwho misinterpret what you say to them as well as your intentions. This is a fact\nof life and something you have to get used to.\nBut what we can control is how efficiently and openly we communicate by\nlearning clear and effective communication skills. The better our communication\nskills, the more clearly we can express ourselves and show sexual interest. The\nmore clearly we express ourselves and show sexual interest, the more likely\nwe’ll be able to connect with women in a sexual and emotional way.\nIt’s sad but true. There are often situations where a woman will be sexually\ninterested in a man, but their failure to communicate their intentions to one\nanother clearly will derail the entire interaction.

This initial\nperception can extend and influence our relationship to the person for weeks or\neven months.\nIf I look at all of the women I’ve dated seriously, just about all of them (I’d\nestimate 90% or so), it felt “on” within the first few minutes of the interaction.\nWe clicked and that first impression led to a romantic and sexual relationship\nfurther down the line.\nThe biggest misconception about first impressions is being overly concerned\nwith what to say to a woman when you meet her.

connection\nUsing Effective Language: This is the easiest “quick fix” that you can apply to\nyour communication skills. Using effective language means saying what you\nmean with the fewest words possible while still maintaining your meaning and\nintent.\nThis is where being a good writer can actually help you become a good\ncommunicator. If you’re saying something in four sentences that could be said in\none, say it in one. If you are saying something in ten words that can be said in\nfour, say it in four.\nIn conversation and communication quality always wins out over quantity. We\nwould all rather have 30 seconds of amazing communication than 10 minutes of\nmediocre communication saying the same thing.\nIt also means removing “um,” “uh,” “ah,” “like,” “you know,” and other fillers\nfrom your everyday speaking.\nRemoving all fillers 100% of the time is often impossible (I still drop an “um,”\nor “you know,” occasionally), but the more of these you remove, the more clear\nand coherent your speaking will be. Nothing screams a lack of sophistication\nlike somebody who sprinkles “like” and “umm” throughout his stories\nconstantly.\nRead the following two sentences out loud:\n“So, um, I guess what I’m saying is like, that I never really felt at home when I\nlived, uh, out there, you know, in California.

The first\none feels very casual, lackadaisical, even lazy and uninterested. The second one\nfeels serious, stern, powerful, and clear.\nQuestions versus Statements: Creating threads of conversation through statement\nis far more powerful than questions. This is because it assumes rapport and\ninstantly makes conversations more personally.\nFor instance, if you’ve been talking to a woman at a bar for a few minutes,\nsaying, “I love olives in my drink. When I was a kid I used to eat them straight\nout of the jar,” is far more interesting than, “Do you like olives in your drink?”\nand waiting for her response.

You don’t ask the question you\nwant to know, but instead, you make a mild prediction.\nInstead of asking her a question about herself, you guess the answer to your\nquestion and then state it.

question, you can simply comment about\nsomething or observe something.Never underestimate the power of non-\nsequiturs.“I’m thinking about quitting drinking.”“A car almost hit me on the way here\ntonight.”“My roommate eats peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwiches.It’s\ndisgusting.”“I’ve always wanted to visit Africa.”These will sometimes come across as random.But that’s because they are —\nthey’re whatever thoughts are popping into your head at the moment.It’s better\nto be random and interesting than predictable and boring.Don’t be afraid to just\nblurt something out.This works because unlike questions, statements require no investment from the\nother person.You can say whatever you want and there’s no implicit expectation\nfor her to generate conversation as well.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"h3umfXE6JCXaqEGEKmUwx9hnbaHALIFb2nH2qxZtPGI="},"8f0f12f6-a5c4-4c21-aaab-d85fe365076d":{"id_":"8f0f12f6-a5c4-4c21-aaab-d85fe365076d","metadata":{"page_number":189,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_189","metadata":{"page_number":189,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"1MrUUwvAJcR0xqfPEf85Gcxchvw1PxZsmKvhlNTCyTM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"282749df-4f51-4d75-9a13-e846820c4113","metadata":{"page_number":189,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"h3umfXE6JCXaqEGEKmUwx9hnbaHALIFb2nH2qxZtPGI="}},"text":"Speaking

and then talk about it, you are now sharing yourself and giving her a\nchance to chime in with her input as well.The amazing thing about speaking in statements is if you do it correctly, she will\nstart asking you questions.This may not seem like a big deal, but it actually\nreorients the entire interaction.As I mentioned earlier, whoever is asking the\nquestions is sub-communicating a desire to learn more about the other, i.e.,\ninterest, i.e., they’re attracted to them.If she is constantly seeking information\nfrom you, you now have the power to control the interaction — you control the\ninformation and the conversation.Endless Conversation Topics: In every topic of conversation, there are countless\nopportunities to jump off onto other topics — there are countless word\nassociations to be made.For instance, let’s assume you’re talking to a woman and she says, “I never liked\nthat restaurant.I went there on my birthday last year, and I don’t remember\nanything past midnight.I woke up on my friend’s kitchen floor.”This is loaded with opportunities to take the conversation in new directions.You\ncould relate and talk about any of the following:\n1.The restaurant she doesn’t like.2.What you did on your last birthday.3.The last time you got black out drunk.4.A story about waking up somewhere unusual.Any and all of these topics will be relevant and interesting to the conversation.If you don’t already do this, it’s a habit you need to ingrain in yourself — just as\nthe comedians ingrain off-the-wall word associations.Here are a series of examples of statements that women may make.In them, I\nhave underlined the “jump off” points.Think of them as intersections where you\ncan choose which direction to move the conversation.As you read through these\nexamples, try to come up with a statement to relate to each jump off point.This\nwill help teach you to be prepared to speak about any topic on the spot.1.“I go to Harvard right now.But I want

The cops ended up busting\nit and some drunken kid got arrested.”\nTry re-reading through these examples and at each underlined word or phrase,\ntry to immediately come up with a thought or response about it. For example, I\nsee Harvard, and I think of how one time I visited there and their campus looks\nlike a palace. I also think of friends of mine who went to Harvard. These are\nboth legitimate places to take the conversation.\nOnce you become competent at this, you’ll notice that this is the way in which\nevery conversation flows. Conversations only end when one person says\nsomething to which the other person has no jump off points. This is what\nhappens when a conversation “dies.” If you teach yourself to recognize jump off\npoints and take advantage of them as soon as possible, you’ll be able to sustain a\nconversation with almost anybody indefinitely.\nCombine this skill with the ability to cold read and create conversational threads\nout of thin air by making statements, and you will literally develop the skill to\nbegin and control any conversation with anybody for any length of time.\nStorytelling: Human beings, by default, are enrapt by stories, or more\nspecifically, a story arc. Politicians use them to campaign, teachers use them to\nexplain important concepts, comedians use them to make us laugh, and we use\nthem constantly in our day-to-day interactions.\nBut what you probably didn’t notice is that the best communicators you know\nare fantastic storytellers.\nHave you ever had a friend who would start telling you about something and it\njust seemed to go nowhere?

have you ever known someone who consistently makes jokes that don’t\ncompletely make sense, or fizzle out and aren’t funny?Or maybe you’re one of these people.Do people ever stop paying attention to\nyou mid-story?Or do you have trouble making others laugh (intentionally, that\nis)?Chances are, these people (or you), aren’t following a strong story arc.For\nwhatever reason, humans have evolved to be absolutely fascinated when\ninformation is communicated in a certain pattern.This is true of just about any\nculture and background.There are three main points of a story arc:\nSet Up: The set up is exactly that: you’re setting the scene or the context for\nwhat you’re about to say.It’s the foundation of what’s about to be told, and if\nyou don’t set up properly, then your stories, jokes, and ideas will always seem to\nbe random.People will consistently comment that you’re really random, weird,\nor “off the wall.”Content/Conflict: After setting up what you’re going to talk about, you get into\nthe actual content.This can also be the “conflict” in your story.Whatever it is,\nit’s something that causes tension and expectancy.The content of your story\nneeds to be intriguing and hook people into wanting to know what will happen\nnext.If you don’t build much tension with the content of your stories, you will\nfind people losing interest or get the feeling like you ramble on a lot.Resolution: The resolution releases the tension from the conflict or content.Resolutions can come in forms of punchlines (for jokes), conclusions (for ideas),\nor just closure for a generic story.People who don’t resolve their stories and\nideas well will often get blank stares when they’re finished speaking, or people\nasking them, “Yeah, and…?”not realizing that the story is finished.Here’s an example of a story with a setup, content/conflict, and a resolution:\nWhen I was in college, my first roommate had a funny habit whenever he\ngot

learn to relate to one another.The examples showed jump off\npoints in individual sentences.In real life, people speak in more than sentences; they speak to each other in\nstories.So you’ll want to

naturally with\nyour friends and family in a lot of situations.The idea is to just do it consistently\nand naturally and with anybody, including attractive women.Relating and Connecting: The final goal of a successful conversation is to\nactually make a personal connection with the woman you’re talking to.When you are talking to a woman, there are only two real subjects of\nconversation: her and you.Everything you speak about should be, in some way,\nrevealing your identity to her or her identity to you.This uncovering of identity is what creates the sense of a “connection.”The\ngreater the connection you create, the more she’ll want to spend time with you\nand vice-versa.Making a connection requires three steps: 1) being open about yourself, 2)\ngetting her to be open about herself, and 3) relating to each other’s experiences.So what do you talk about?How do you talk about yourself openly?When I tell\nguys “talk about yourself more.Open up.”A lot of them go out and say, “I’m\nfrom New York.I like baseball.I’m 27.”It’s good that they’re sharing\nthemselves now, but that’s a bit

now that we’ve covered how to hold a dynamic and interesting conversation,\nlet’s talk about how to spice it up.Let’s talk about humor.Humor\nThere’s an old saying, if you can make a woman laugh then you can get her to\nlaugh right into bed.Now, although humor is not a cure-all for anybody’s dating\nproblems, it’s definitely important.In fact, in many surveys of what women look\nfor most in a man, “sense of humor” is almost always at the top of that list.The reason is that a strong sense of humor conveys all of the attractive traits of\nyour identity to a woman.A man who can laugh easily at the world and who\nisn’t afraid to laugh at himself conveys a sense of non-neediness.He also makes\nwomen feel good around him and, therefore, more secure.A man who is very\nserious and unable to laugh at himself or the world conveys that he is heavily\ninvested in the perceptions of the world around him and is therefore needy.Your specific type of sense of humor isn’t so important as much as that you have\nit.Obviously, different women will respond strongly to different types of humor,\nbut this is less a function of your ability to tell jokes and more a function of\ndemographics.Sarcastic women will like sarcastic men.Silly women will like\nsilly men, and so on.Focus on what you find funny to you personally, and don’t\nbe afraid to share that with the women you meet.If they laugh, then great!If\nthey don’t, then chances are it wasn’t going to work anyway.At its core, humor is the art of drawing connections between two seemingly\nunrelated ideas or objects.There are a number of ways to do this, but at its core,\nhumor is a creative activity and, therefore, will greatly be tied to your ability to\nuninhibitedly express yourself.Sometimes your jokes will fall flat, particularly when you’re starting out.That’s\nOK.Don’t laugh at yourself.Don’t make fun of yourself.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"D9tdmdyRQfx8hfRHk84r8ktpPwqTS8QhzW0GA5m6HLg="},"4da95ef5-acbd-43c4-a061-4b07e67e8f9a":{"id_":"4da95ef5-acbd-43c4-a061-4b07e67e8f9a","metadata":{"page_number":196,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_196","metadata":{"page_number":196,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"DyNSgYTGrkedX1avk614Ce3W7HCcE4exm7PAXxjilU4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"97d1fa6c-e9c5-400d-aa78-0a56272a865d","metadata":{"page_number":196,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"D9tdmdyRQfx8hfRHk84r8ktpPwqTS8QhzW0GA5m6HLg="}},"text":"That’s\nOK.Don’t

One of the most common and easiest forms of humor is\nmisdirection.Misdirection occurs when you begin to say something or tell a\nstory that leads the listener to believe you’re making one point, and then out of\nnowhere you say something completely different.For instance, here’s a famous\nline by Steve Martin:\n“You know that look women get when they want to have sex? ...Yeah, me\nneither.”The line sets you up to believe that he’s going to tell you a story about the time a\nwoman gave him a look like she wanted to have sex with him.But he misdirects\nyou and ends up making a joke about his own sexual inexperience.Here’s\nanother one from Jimmy Fallon:\n“There’s a new book out called ‘Why Women Have Sex’ that says there are 237\nreasons why women have sex.And folks, David Letterman knows the top 10.”Again, he sets up the joke by telling you about a new book out relating to why\nwomen have sex.But he then takes the idea of there being 237 reasons why\nwomen have sex and relates it to David Letterman’s famous “Top 10” segments\non his show and the fact that Letterman got caught sleeping with his interns.It’s\nthe connection of these two seemingly unrelated topics that makes it funny.Exaggeration: Exaggeration is another mainstay of humor and something that\neveryone should be able to use.Exaggeration is when you take a quality about\nsomething, and blow it completely out of proportion, often in a creative or\ninteresting way.For instance:\n“She’s a nice woman, though.Nicest three acres of flesh I’ve ever met.”Obviously, no woman actually has three acres worth of flesh.But the\nexaggeration of her being fat is what causes this line to be funny.There’s also a\nsubtle misdirection in the line (going from “she’s nice” to “she’s fat”).Typically, the more creative and extreme you are in describing your\nexaggeration, the funnier it will be.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"c+9FF4xHDu9p8ME+QCxMGoczN6ISD8UJmTCyl4a8CUc="},"d7716b49-b106-4749-82dd-015bcb4c9bd0":{"id_":"d7716b49-b106-4749-82dd-015bcb4c9bd0","metadata":{"page_number":197,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_197","metadata":{"page_number":197,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"KnIAgL+gJbGKmcNTmOT9Vyrh7XQvMWH5ctFcx6vpIEQ="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"86ec620e-f1b7-4560-9c0b-2a429eaf8b43","metadata":{"page_number":197,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"c+9FF4xHDu9p8ME+QCxMGoczN6ISD8UJmTCyl4a8CUc="}},"text":"For

seen more attractive things in the bottom of an airport urinal.”\nNotice the second one is far more extreme and creative. The completely\nunrelated ideas of an airport urinal and a girl’s face (I’m laughing just typing\nthis) is what creates the greater degree of humor.\nIn humor, the more specific and odd the details, typically the more funny a joke\nis.\nTeasing and Sarcasm: Whereas misdirection and exaggeration are funny to just\nabout anybody, you’ll run into a minority of women who don’t find teasing or\nsarcasm funny. Teasing and sarcasm can also vary in degrees of appropriateness,\nespecially depending on where you are. If you’re at a funeral, it’s probably not a\ngood idea to make sarcastic comments about the deceased’s family.\nTeasing is when you make humorous comments that are derogatory about\nsomeone. Generally, teasing is done in good humor and with good intentions.\nTeasing with bad intentions becomes insulting and is not welcome by most\npeople.\nTeasing is supposed to be fun. The ideal tease will create a mixture of emotions\nin a girl: defensiveness yet happiness. The ideal reaction is when a girl will say,\n“Oh my god, I can’t believe you said that,” but will be laughing at the same time\nand smiling. Here are a couple examples of teases:\n(To a woman wearing bright red shoes)\n“Are you going to click your heels to go home later?”\n(To a woman sitting by herself in the corner looking bored)\n“So who put you in timeout?”\n(To a woman waving a dollar bill at the bartender to get his attention)\n“Is that how you always get men to pay attention to you?”\nBe careful with teases, especially to women you don’t know. I said the last one\nto a woman I didn’t know and got slapped.

Teasing polarizes, often hard and quickly. Therefore, it’s a good\ntactic, but not always exactly pleasant.\nSometimes girls will genuinely be offended or sensitive to teasing and not react\nwell. I’d say maybe 1/3 of the women I meet do not react well to teasing or a\ngood-natured ribbing. Make a point to spot these women and let the teasing go.\nGenerally women who don’t enjoy being teased really appreciate genuine\ncompliments, so I switch it up.\nSarcasm is an even darker form of humor than teasing. Sarcasm works on even\nfewer women, but the women who appreciate it really appreciate it. Chances are\na lot of you reading this don’t have a very sarcastic sense of humor. That’s fine.\nYou can just live a sexless and lonely life forever.\n(That was sarcasm if you missed it.)\nSeriously, sarcasm isn’t for everybody. Sarcasm is when you make an extreme\nstatement that’s completely opposite of what you actually mean. You often say it\nwith complete seriousness and without smiling.\nA lot of women won’t get sarcastic humor. They’ll think you’re being serious or\nthey’ll get confused. Others don’t enjoy it very much. But I will say, in my\nexperience, when a woman loves sarcasm, she loves sarcasm.\nYears ago, I was out with a girl at a bar. We had been flirting all night and she\nhad a very sarcastic sense of humor. At one point she looked at my drink and\nsaid, “You drink slow, I’ve already finished my drink!\"\nI replied with a totally straight face, “Not all of us hate ourselves as much as you\ndo.”\nShe nearly fell over laughing. She loved it and we ended up having a great\nrelationship together.\nThe Role of Swearing: Swearing and dirty language has an interesting role in\nhumor.

For instance, adding the word “fucking” into\njust about any humorous statement will make it pack a little more of a punch.\nAt the same time, using swear words is kind of a shortcut, and if you use them\ntoo often, they’ll get old quickly and sound try-hard. Dropping a well-timed F-\nbomb can make a funny joke even funnier. But dropping an F-bomb into\neverything you say just makes you look unsophisticated.\nGenerally, the older you are, the more I recommend avoiding dirty language. Use\nit sparingly and only use it when you have a specific reason to. The more you\nuse it, the more attention-seeking and negative you will make yourself appear,\nboth of which are unattractive traits.\nWordplay and Puns: Wordplay is similar to misdirection in that the listener\nexpects one type of meaning and gets another, but wordplay practices\nmisdirection by using words that have various meanings.\nA few examples:\n“Hurry, a passenger is ill. We need to get to a hospital.”\n“What is it?”\n“It’s a building with lots of doctors. But we don’t have time for that.”\nOr:\n“Surely, you can’t be serious!”\n“I am serious. And please, don’t call me Shirley.”\nI would say that puns and wordplay are an even rarer form of appreciated humor\nthan sarcasm. Puns and wordplay also tend to be very intellectual. You’ll find\nfew women who appreciate them. And chances are even fewer of you reading\nthis like to say them. But again, when you do find a woman who appreciates\nthem, in my experience she really appreciates them.\nRoleplaying and Games: Games and roleplaying are quick and easy ways to\ninject fun into any interaction with a woman. They’re playful. And they open up\nplenty of opportunities for other types of humor when you use them.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1741,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"3NO1w2+86j6fPG5SXKVYZ5hnHazMANqH5veITni1ga0="},"97e7886e-04f8-418b-9982-74609bc3c70e":{"id_":"97e7886e-04f8-418b-9982-74609bc3c70e","metadata":{"page_number":201,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_201","metadata":{"page_number":201,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"HoTcK1cc5sDVgODUzQg/bSktwPjbAiC+0vEOEW1OwYA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"7b6156b3-1744-447a-af1d-4a8925973a07","metadata":{},"hash":"38U0wk9qWeMF1Aj8ZodGHxJjGVgt6utrmiefFKnuxyw="}},"text":"Games can be anything from basic physical games (hand slaps, thumb wars, etc.)\nto word games (five questions game, fuck/marry/kill, etc.).For instance,\nfuck/marry/kill is easy.You point to three random

based on people\nwatching.Roleplaying can be just as energizing and fun.Roleplaying basically involves\ngiving the woman you’re talking to a fake role and then playing around with that\nrole.Some of my favorite roleplaying involves marriage/divorce roleplaying.For instance, when I first meet a girl, let’s say within 30 seconds she says\nsomething I don’t like.I’ll say, “That’s it, we’re getting divorced.”It’s funny\nbecause I just met her, but you can actually milk a lot of fun out of something\nsimple like this — for example, “You keep the kids, I’m moving to Europe.”“By\nthe way, your music sucks, and I never liked your casseroles either.”If you find yourself having a lot of trouble with humor, I recommend watching a\nlot of stand-up comedians.Some of my favorites are Louis CK, George Carlin,\nand Bill Hicks.Pay attention to their delivery, their timing, and their facial\nexpressions.These things can’t be taught in a book, so pay attention to them.Pick a few of your favorite comics and watch their stand-up routines multiple\ntimes to get a real sense of how they tell a story and how they nail a punchline.Also, beware of falling into the trap of self-deprecating humor.A

is not a cure-all for your problems with attracting and seducing women\n(if there were a cure-all, it’d be physicality; Chapter 14).

The worst part about this habit is that it all\nhappens while making the woman laugh and making her enjoy your company.\nSo a lot of men get confused and actually think that they’re seducing her.

And although humor is a very useful tool to help you do that, it\ndoesn’t actually do it for you.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":980,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"aIMwLxWcE8+lCWD1xKN3Sn7akQK8K2gRSaiZvFUOoUA="},"71bc33f2-10ea-4dda-9ff9-22d91fbbb105":{"id_":"71bc33f2-10ea-4dda-9ff9-22d91fbbb105","metadata":{"page_number":203,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_203","metadata":{"page_number":203,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"bJ7g7fddpDC3E7pOH/EeSxZBRSriftuzDRKfERXAja8="}},"text":"Chapter 13:\nThe Dating Process\nLike it or not, the dating process follows a somewhat rigid line. Boy meets girl,\nasks girl on date, corresponds with girl, sets up date with girl, corresponds with\ngirl, sets up second date with girl, repeat until eventually you bring girl home\nwith you, and at some point you decide if you’re exclusive, non-exclusive, a\ncasual couple, fuck buddies, soul-mates, or never want to see each other ever\nagain.\nThere are exceptions to this process, and the process can be sped up to a degree,\nbut more or less, there’s a courtship process that we all follow. Our culture has\nsilently defined a procedure for these things, and any man who wishes to be\nsuccessful with women needs to be aware of the procedure.\nThe process almost always involves the following: trading of contact details,\ntalking through text or phone conversations, going on dates, sex, and figuring\nout what kind of relationship (if any) will result. Usually (but not always) in that\norder. In certain instances, the contact details and date can be forgone and you\ncan bring her home (or go home with her) the day/night you meet her. But these\ncases are rare and usually involve meeting a woman in a party or nightclub\nsituation which we won’t get into a whole lot of depth about.\nPhone Numbers\nThere’s a minor obsession in men’s dating advice about phone numbers,\ncorrespondence, and so-called “text game” or “flake prevention.”\nFlaking is a term often used to describe a woman who gives you her phone\nnumber, says she wants to see you again, and then either never responds or\nreturns your call, or never shows up on a date. Flakes can simply be women who\nnever respond to you or women who respond but keep sidestepping meeting up\nwith you.\nObsessing about flakes and how to win them over is an easy trap to fall into. But\nin my opinion, this is treating the symptom, not the illness.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1880,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"UFb2BwVQm+eQm1QUsiCnasjeMkMKUi0Jtve6mQjYTL0="},"7a937eb0-b0d5-4f68-a71d-c901e9700bdc":{"id_":"7a937eb0-b0d5-4f68-a71d-c901e9700bdc","metadata":{"page_number":204,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_204","metadata":{"page_number":204,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"QdNvMWhoiT4juJs4K1HfM1syDYGI3H0Pn0PQ0n1A+GU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5ec62175-95b9-4206-95a9-844d761414e6","metadata":{},"hash":"sDgqQhGs9Ww3YkUgxl5+EJ0r22JWtqableUJbTHNs2I="}},"text":"The way to prevent flakes is to meet and attract women who are so interested in\nyou that they would never consider flaking.Problem solved.In my experience, 99% of the so-called flake prevention strategies guys\nimplement — calling at certain times, baiting with open-ended texts, pretending\nto send a text to the “wrong person” — these will rarely convince a girl who was\nnever attracted to you to suddenly become attracted to you.And even if by some\nchance they do convince her to meet up with you, you’re now on a date with a\nwoman who has no genuine interest being there with you.Similarly, men spend way too much time obsessing over unimportant details like\nhow many times to text each day, how soon to call her, when to ask her out, etc.\nSetting rigid rules such as “wait three days to ask her out” or “never text her\ntwice in a row,” greatly limits you and will hinder the unique connection you\nspent your time developing with the woman.And by the way, it’s that\nconnection that’s going to get her out to see you again, not the clever text you\nspent 45 minutes coming up with.But with that said, here is my version of “The Rules” to calling and texting\nwomen:\n- Only ask a woman for her phone number if she seems genuinely attracted\nand interested in you.Only ask for her number if you can see yourself\nwanting to hang out with her again or having time to hang out with her\nagain.If you meet a girl who is in town for a bachelorette party for three\ndays, is drunk, and you have a serious meeting at work in two days, don’t\nbother.- When you ask her for her phone number, don’t come up with a fancy line\nor make up a reason.Just ask her for it.If you’re attracted to her, you\nshouldn’t be afraid to hide it (you’re a confident, dominant man,\nremember?).If she’s attracted to you, she’ll be more than excited to give it\nto you.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"dPdTtmRFha2nSA22/Hag1ouyabPb2KyNtE9Sz/dDefU="},"5ec62175-95b9-4206-95a9-844d761414e6":{"id_":"5ec62175-95b9-4206-95a9-844d761414e6","metadata":{"page_number":204,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_204","metadata":{"page_number":204,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"QdNvMWhoiT4juJs4K1HfM1syDYGI3H0Pn0PQ0n1A+GU="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"7a937eb0-b0d5-4f68-a71d-c901e9700bdc","metadata":{"page_number":204,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"dPdTtmRFha2nSA22/Hag1ouyabPb2KyNtE9Sz/dDefU="}},"text":"If

And more specifically, why women have it, and why they\nwould ever want to have it with you.\nFemale sexuality has been a murky area in psychology for almost a century now.\nFreud famously said at one point, “The great question that has never been\nanswered, and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years\nof research into the feminine soul, is ‘what do women want?’”\nAmong researchers, it was long thought that female arousal was tied to ideas and\ndisplay of security, investment and commitment, particularly from high-status\nmen.\nBut if you think about it, you know, here in the real world, this doesn’t really\nmake sense. Because unfortunately for psychologists, women don’t light candles\nand lay in their bathtubs masturbating to a mortgage and a white picket fence.\nThey fantasize about far different (and stranger) things.\nIn her book, My Secret Garden, the journalist Nancy Friday collected\nanonymous sexual fantasies from women around the world. If you ever want\nyour mind expanded in an interesting way, check it out. There are women out\nthere who get turned on by some really, well, let’s call it “creative” stuff. We’re\ntalking about gangbangs, rape, weird locations and positions, anonymous men,\nand so on and so forth.\nSo this sort of data threw a bit of a monkey wrench into everything. For many\nyears, scientists didn’t really know where to start. With men it was pretty easy —\nwe’re primarily visually stimulated, and we generally all like similar features\n(symmetry, certain hip/waist ratio, large breasts, etc.)\nBut with women, you may as well throw shit at a dartboard because that’s about\nas far as things were getting.\nOne new conclusion in arousal research these days is that female arousal is\nsomewhat narcissistic in nature.

being\ndesired.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1876,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HYxtAyV58Ykeh3EImn/4r2QYVxpj9spm/9sDp11+EoY="},"e639703b-3368-45ac-90c3-39b7b1d63da8":{"id_":"e639703b-3368-45ac-90c3-39b7b1d63da8","metadata":{"page_number":214,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_214","metadata":{"page_number":214,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"E7PxtAXCz0pUN1bCVvTvMkalTXIZ4TLJYObMdUdkzks="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d0c39508-6587-4fce-88f6-fdfe80c1f71e","metadata":{},"hash":"LjJlHFYtHhoDPdwsqA8M8lRYryoGWVmq5WUqYYTJ32U="}},"text":"(Note:

amazing.I used to hang out with him and would watch him awkwardly\nstumble around conversations, drink a little too much, and awkwardly putting his\narm around girls as the girls sat there with a look of confusion.I’d watch him\nand think to myself, “Oh man, what a disaster.”And then I’d come back 20 minutes later and he’d be making out with her.And\nthen an hour later she’d be excitedly going home with him.He just has no inhibitions whatsoever about going for it.Unless the girl would\nclearly stop him or say “No!”he would always be going for it.And the women\nloved it.They loved his physicality and his raw sexual energy.It made them feel\nbeautiful and sexy and it was exciting.(Ethical note here: if a woman clearly tells you to stop doing something, stop.Don’t take offense, but instead, ask her if she’s uncomfortable and/or why she’s\nuncomfortable.Often it’s not that she doesn’t like you, it’s just that you’re\nmoving too fast for her.Always respect her boundaries and clarify as early as\npossible what she’s comfortable with and what her expectations are.Not only is\nthis the vulnerable thing to do, it’s also the respectful thing to do.)Being physical with women is a necessary habit that most men who are poor\nwith women never do.Most men are a bit shy and hesitant when it comes to\n“making moves:” touching, the first kiss, sexual touching, etc. Well, that needs\nto stop.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"MJZAXoyCPLFb0drnGlSkJgdM8aODRJ3adbZpcHr842E="},"79236e26-46e8-413c-8c2c-c79433e6e0ea":{"id_":"79236e26-46e8-413c-8c2c-c79433e6e0ea","metadata":{"page_number":215,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_215","metadata":{"page_number":215,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"maT9G/I8R7IuUOCmwyrmV0SDe2doE58Kx2J2W+7EbY8="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"0fe600ad-ac6c-432f-8924-35e127a2fd1a","metadata":{"page_number":215,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"MJZAXoyCPLFb0drnGlSkJgdM8aODRJ3adbZpcHr842E="}},"text":"From

Moving Ahead\nThere’s a lot to digest in this book.And if you’re a first-timer who hasn’t started\nhis journey of self-improvement to become more attractive to women, it’s easy\nto get overwhelmed and wonder where to start.That’s why I’ve put together this small Action Plan at the end of the book, to not\nonly give you a clear place to start but also help you see what you should focus\non and in which order.The Action Plan is divided up into sections of five tasks or challenges.Once\nyou’ve completed at least four of the tasks in each section, move on to the next\nsection.In Section 1, some tasks you will naturally have handled.For instance, if\nyou already work out regularly, then that’s fine.In other sections, an item\ndoesn’t count unless you do it since starting that section.For instance, in Section\n5, you’re challenged to have sex with a woman you’ve never had sex with\nbefore.Obviously, not everyone reading this is a virgin.Some of you may even\nhave sex with a woman in previous sections.But it doesn’t count until you get to\nsection 5.Obviously, these aren’t rigid rules.But the sections are laid out here to challenge\nyou and give you clearly defined goals and benchmarks to strive for.In all\nsections, some tasks will be very easy for you.Others will be very difficult.It\nwill vary from person to person, but the idea is to give you a general path to\nfollow when it comes to improving yourself.Also realize, that this is a long-term process.A lot of these tasks won’t be\ncompleted in one night or even in one weekend.A lot of them will require weeks\nor months of effort.But that’s OK.That means you probably really needed to\nwork on it.Level 1: Your Foundation (Complete 5 of 5)\nJoin a gym: If you’re not already a member of a gym, join one.If you’re

If It Was A Gift?Over the course of the previous 230 pages, we’ve discovered that attraction\nflows from women perceiving non-neediness and a sense of inner security in\nmen.This confidence and security arise from having a stronger identity and\ninvestment in oneself than in the perception of others.This sub-communicates\nthat as a man, you’re dependable, confident and high status (or likely to become\nhigh status).The way to cultivate a higher investment in oneself, the way to becoming more\nconfident, is actually counterintuitive.We learned that showing vulnerability,\nboth in emotion and action, actually leads to a higher investment in oneself and\nhigher non-neediness.This newfound confidence then allows you to express yourself more clearly and\ndirectly.When you express yourself more clearly and directly, you polarize the\nreactions of women, opening yourself up to more rejection, but also attracting\nother women stronger than ever before.Attracting women occurs through a\nprocess of self-selection.The rate at which you attract them happens through a\nprocess of overcoming fear.And the consistency in which you seduce those\nwomen attracted happens through a process of expressing your sexuality.These\nare the three fundamentals.Presented in these pages are all of the tools I can ever imagine a man ever\nneeding to renovate himself and become more successful with women.Undoubtedly for you, it will be difficult at times.You will run into speed bumps,\ndetours, distractions, and emotional highs lows.But if you persist and stay\noptimistic, you will get there.I’m absolutely sure of it.And in those times that it does become difficult, those times where you do get\nfrustrated and fall back to your unconfident beliefs, your desire for external\nvalidation, where you let yourself become swayed by the whims of others rather\nthan your internal compass, you may feel lost or hopeless.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"7qiUONqzQA2CmuKo98T/LglIlWI+0kSAse6ilpYblc8="},"0f375488-32df-41d9-848b-1bf39f794129":{"id_":"0f375488-32df-41d9-848b-1bf39f794129","metadata":{"page_number":231,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_231","metadata":{"page_number":231,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"Sgi0NkJyPOpQKm6AbTJIk9l6t6boupvkmzR3v4DoQ+M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c89a4812-5914-4146-87ab-262a4106fa6f","metadata":{"page_number":231,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"7qiUONqzQA2CmuKo98T/LglIlWI+0kSAse6ilpYblc8="}},"text":"This

“What if it was a gift?”and then try to rationalize a way it could be so.Because you see, in the world of emotions, there are no absolutes; you can\nusually draw whichever conclusions you desire.So why not choose to draw\nconclusions of blessings, positivity, and gifts?Ex-girlfriend dumps you and left you for another man.What if it was a gift?Because without her, you would not have been put on this path of self-\nimprovement, and you would have forever been stuck in a relationship full of\ndeceit and without self-awareness.A woman makes fun of your hair and calls you ugly.What if it was a gift?Such\na harsh rejection will steel you into becoming even more confident in the future,\nand hopefully, will inspire you to re-evaluate how you look.Your friends tell you that approaching women is creepy and that you’re a loser\nfor wanting to do it.What if it was a gift?It shows that what you’re doing and\nwhat you’re working on is pushing social boundaries, is polarizing, and is\nultimately making you more controversial and attractive.When I was 19 years old, a friend of mine drowned right in front of me.We were\nat a party on a lake.One minute he was there, laughing, smiling, joking, and the\nnext moment he was gone.Forever.It was one of the biggest gifts I’ve ever been given.Not because it was good.It\nwas tragic.But because of how it affected me ever

Current research posits women are primarily\naroused through displays of sexual intent and bold behaviors. See Also:\nSexual Intent, Courage\nAssortment Effect — The psychological term for the observed tendency for\nmen and women of similar beliefs and self-perceptions to attract one another.\nFor instance, a man with low self-esteem will attract women with low self-\nesteem. A man with a positive attitude towards sex will attract women with\npositive attitudes towards sex.

Attractive behavior is usually a result of\nvulnerability, although not always. See Also: Lifestyle, Neediness\nBoundaries — The limit of interaction and communication one finds\nacceptable. Boundaries can be strong or weak based upon the person’s\nconfidence level. For instance, John lacks confidence and therefore lets his\ndates make fun of him without saying anything. Sally has high confidence\nand does not tolerate her date being 20 minutes late to pick her up. Strong\nboundaries are both a cause and effect of True Confidence. Standing up for\none’s boundaries often triggers attraction and always generates greater\nrespect. See Also: True Confidence\nConfidence — One’s belief in themselves and their ability and competence in a\ncertain situation. Confidence is context-dependent. One can be confident in a\nboardroom but horribly unconfident in a sexual relationship. Confidence is\noften confused with self-esteem.

Most men hide the thoughts and emotions they believe will\nmake them less attractive. This forces them to behave conditionally and base\ntheir behaviors on the beliefs and perceptions of those around them. This is\nunconfident behavior and ultimately makes them unattractive. Paradoxically,\nmaking oneself vulnerable and surrendering to criticism and not expecting\nanything in return from others causes one to build self-esteem, become more\nconfident and more attractive.","textTemplate":"","endCharIdx":1594,"metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XkXKGqmHl0wUd08hL5Syhjm/3wnSrrCoD0iAMUzXMkw="},"2e00de76-4e59-45c7-88f1-903ec3589643":{"id_":"2e00de76-4e59-45c7-88f1-903ec3589643","metadata":{"page_number":241,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf_241","metadata":{"page_number":241,"total_pages":243,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\hashi\\Documents\\fiverr-demo-without-LP\\fiverr-demo\\data\\models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","file_name":"models-attract-women-through-honesty.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"D5EccGPY7/MI/dCRspgQMtAIe+LEmOdQMNFOGPdsPLI="}},"text":"Further Reading\nIf you feel you gained a lot from this book and have never read my website, then\nthat is the next logical destination.

However, the risk with body building is that it can\nturn into a highly narcissist womb. I often think the mirrors\nin the gyms are not so much to perfect the form, but to\nperfect the ego.

It is putting your ego on\nthe line. Why should you do this? Because there is a greater\nrisk than if you don't. Why have a woman if all you don't\ninvest some of your emotion in it? It ruins the fun and the\nlove.\n\"But Pook! You said be desireless!\"\nDesireless means controlling yourself rather than\nhaving her control you. And this is at the beginning. After a\nwhile with a girl, you SHOULD want to put some\nemotional attachment in.\n\"But what if I get hurt!?\" Then you still win! Would\nyou be here at this forum, learning how to be a Don Juan,\nif you got the woman you wanted?\nYou should thank the girl you didn't get because now\nyou are a Don Juan. (Imagine if you were an AFC for your\nentire life! Yech!) If something similiar occurs, the same\nradical improvement will follow.\nDo not use DJism as an armor for the risk of emotional\nattachment. DJing is a TOOL to a goal. The goal is not\nDJism itself.\nDating is a Win-Win\nDo not look at women as a win or lose game. THE\nGOAL is to find a woman you love and one who loves you\nback (without either settling). The goal is NOT to make\nevery chick like you.

out on an occasional basis\nand having fun.\nAlthough dating may lead to a relationship, it doesn’t\nhave to. Understandably, people at this school don’t always\nhave the time or desire for a significant other. But many of\nus want to hang out on an individual basis with members\nof the opposite sex that we like. And we aren’t necessarily\nhappy with the predominant means of doing that — party\nhookups. Casual dating is the perfect, middle-of-the- road\nsolution to this problem.\nI know that asking a girl for her number or out to\ncoffee or dinner can be hard, but it needs to be done. We\nladies aren’t mean! We try to encourage proactive\nbehavior.\nAlthough rejection is always a possibility, the alterna‐\ntive is just too attractive and too necessary to pass up. Do\nyou really want to go through your prime years of your\nyouth — without some form of dating?\nI should hope not.\nThis was an actual letter from a lady written to all the\nmen.

This is for the shy, the homebodies, the ones on\nthe Internet every night.\nYou want a girlfriend badly. It seemed like two choices:\nthe hook-ups you find at parties or clubs or the ‘virtual\nmarriage’ of a ‘long term relationship’.\nThe flaws of the ‘joined at the hip’ virtual marriage the\nladies described are many. It keeps you from meeting other\npeople. And it is just a clinginess of each other, of two\npeople tired of being ‘single’. You can be successful at this\nwith marriage and everything, but even that may result in\nfailure.

Women do not listen to each other, they FEEL\none another. They cheer one another up. See those phone\nlines that are on fire due to women getting home from\ndates and calling each other? Female gossip is female ther‐\napy. As soon as they walk out of class, they must call\nsomeone on their cell phone immediately.\nWe know men 'think' and women 'feel', but not in such\na bizarre context. Everything a woman says will be 'feel‐\ning'. Women are always touching each other (just not in\nour universe). Feeling, feeling, feeling... that is the sum of\nwomanese.\nIn this universe, we view Womanese as an almost\ntype of Matrix code.

backwards. At the\nthreshold of youth, they look on older age with disgust,\nfear, and boredom. “I must have my fun NOW,” they say.\nSo off they go, making famine of time where abundance\nlies, spending their time rather than investing it. When they\nget older, their future is exactly as they thought. Since they\nplanted no seeds of talent or skill, they had nothing to\nharvest so their happiness starved. With this future, they\nthink they were right because their future came as\npredicted. So then they spread the error by advising youth\nto act like they did.\nOthers have been able to checkmate Time. They see it\nthat as one gets older, Life gets easier. So they work hard in\ntheir youth, carving out a comfortable place in the world.\nAnd as time passes, their work grows easier as does their\nfame. Since they invested their time rather than spent it,\ntalent, skill, intelligence, and ability grow in abundance. In\nthis life, there is no real decay.\nIt is the Don Juan that is timeless. What is his origin?\nHe is in literature, history, plays, and has become a legend.\nIt is the Don Juan’s imagination that the world and women\nfind so fascinating. No one ever wrote an opera on the Nice\nGuy or an epic on the philosopher.\nEvery woman to me is a portal of discovery. They are\nall emissaries of Nature, delivering you news on how life\nworks. To many men, anything is easier, from nuclear\nphysics to climbing the tips of mountains, than dealing\nwith a woman he truly loves. Why? With her, he will be\nunable to hide from himself.\nWomen are at their loudest when they’re lonely. This is\nalso true with dogs.\nHave you ever noticed how some people spend their\nlives trying to get loved more by strangers than their\ncommunity?
